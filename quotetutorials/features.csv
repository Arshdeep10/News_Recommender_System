"Charanjit Singh Teja,Tribune News Service,Amritsar, September 9,With 25 publishers abounding the Bazaar Mai Sewan, it was considered once the world’s largest setting of Punjabi (Gurmukhi) books. But as of now, all glory has been lost in the mists of time.,The original area starting from Darshni Deorhi to Chowk Ghanta Ghar, which was more than 200ft, has been reduced. Several historic buildings, including Udasi Akhara, Sangal Wala Akhara, Gianian Wala Bunga and Hathi Khanna dotting the bazaar are all gone.,Meanwhile, a big chunk of the history was demolished by the government for the construction of Galiara around the Golden Temple in 1988. Most of the book sellers and publishers were moved to other markers, while many left the business. Today, you could say the market is totally no-nostalgia-evoking, unrecognisable remnant of its past grandeur. Only shops of drafting materials, hotels and religious symbols can be seen. A scanty of booksellers is the only reminder.,During the much-condemned attack of the Indian Army on Akal Takht in 1984, a number of shops were reduced to ashes. Come 1988, the government’s decision of Galiara at the expense of market left many sellers in turmoil. Many were displaced.,Narinderpal Singh, owner of Mehar Singh and sons, laments: “They didn’t care about its legacy during the Galiara’s construction. The business of books is perfect, but the new generations of the publishers are not adopting it. Religious literature is high in demand. We are sitting at the heart of Sikh world and customers from all over the world visit us. The government ruined our market.”,Gursagar Singh, owner of Singh brothers, recalls: “There was a great time of the market, when it was the hub of the Punjabi literature. The business is good, but owing to scenarios several prominent publishers have switched to other occupation.”,Balwinder Singh, former Head of the Guru Ramdas School of Planning at Guru Nanak Dev University, sai: “I have submitted a thesis for MPhil on Bazaar Mai Sewan to my guide BS Brar. Once, it was world’s largest market of Gurmukhi books. Now, it’s almost ruined; the market witnessed huge changes during the 20th Century.”,With the emergence of Gurumukhi printing press, a large number of these were established in Lahore and Amritsar. The first Punjabi printing press (using Gurmukhi font) was established through a Christian mission in Ludhiana in 1835. Eminent Punjabi writer Bhai Vir Singh established Wazir Hind Press in the city in 1899. During the 1980s, Lahore became a hub of Gurmukhi printing presses publishing religious text and Qissas.,Meanwhile, Amritsar emerged as the main market of religious and Gurmukhi literature. During the early 20th Century, a large number of publishers settled in the Bazaar Mai Sewan and established their machines. Famous Qissakar (story writer) Kishan Singh Arif (1836-1904), whose father Narain Singh was a publisher and bookseller in the same bazaar, published Qissa Shirin Farhad, Puran Bhagat, Raja Bharthari, Raja Rasaloo, Dulla Bhatti and Kalianwali Heer.,A number of publishers, including Mehar Singh and Sons, Buta Singh-Partap Singh, Chattar Singh-Jewan Singh, Singh Brothers, Khalsa Brothers, Jawahar Singh-Kirpal Singh, Uttam Singh-Gurmukh Singh, Ameer Bhandar, Kastoori Lal and Sons, Munshi Chirag Deen, Bhai Fakeer Singh and sons and Ladha Singh-Kartar Singh among others had established their presses later on and published religious literature.,The Bazaar Mai Sewan started early in the Ranjit Singh era (1780-1839). It was Maharaja Ranjit Singh, who dedicated this bazaar to a lady named Mai Sewan. She was the wife of a military commander Fateh Singh Kaaliawaala. Mai Sewan was known for her dedicated services at the Durbar Sahib and was one of the most respected figures among the locals. Interestingly, a myth also runs parallel to the belief. It is said that it belongs to Mai Sewan, a devotee of the third Sikh Guru — Amardas ji. Once, she expressed her desire of wanting her name to live forever to the master. The Guru is said to have complied with the demand. When fifth Guru Arjan Dev developed the city and allotted land to the settlers, a bazaar leading to Guru Ke Mehal (residence of Guru) was dedicated to Mai Sewan.","Sep 10, 2020

"The Panorama, a visual depiction of the important stages of the Maharaja was set up in 2006 at a cost of Rs5 crore by the then Chief Minister Parkash Sigh Badal with his personal interest. A two-storeyed circular building features paintings depicting the six major battles of the Mahraja. It is accompanied by a multimedia representation of the sights and sounds of war.,: The fort of Attock traditionally regarded as the sentinel of India on the border with Afghanistan, was recaptured in 1813 from Wazir Fateh Khan and his army marking the liberation of Northern India from Afghans. The battle was won under the overall command of Ranjit Singh with Diwan Mokham Chand in operation accompanied by Hari Singh Nalwa, Mian Gausha and Sardar Dal Singh with a strong Punjabi force.,Maharaja Ranjit Singh was a great general, who wanted to modernise his army after seeing the superiority of the British troops. He inducted several Europeans to facilitate this. JF Allard and JB Venture, the two French officers, who were inducted by Maharaja Ranjit Singh for modernising his army, had served Napoleon in his campaigns. In the painting, they are seen inspecting an organised infantry on the one side and cavalry on the other. All personnel are in right army outfit. Many of them are carrying long arm guns.","Sep 11, 2020

"With the festive season ringing in, styling the furniture is one of the easiest ways to add sparkle and festive zing to your home. Here are some tips and tricks to do up your centre and dining table:,Natural finish,Go for natural and eco-friendly accessories. Experiment with a crochet or kantha table cloth or even one reimagined through an old sari, table mats of natural materials like bamboo, handloom or even plantain leaves. Locally sourced flowers like mogra, marigold and champa, accompanied by candles and table runners, are a great idea. Place different potted succulents in a galvanised tray for visual impact. “For a large table, place foraged flowers and branches in a vase for effect. Fresh evergreen boughs and pinecones are a classic decor. For outdoors, beautify the table with a sculptural piece of driftwood,” says Hemil Parikh of Elysium Abodes LLP.,Style cues,It is time to take out the silver. Polish it and let it speak for you at your centre table. “Place large pieces of silverware inwards and the medium-size ones in their periphery. Set the dining table with mats, quarter plates, dining plates and cutlery from left to right. Place napkins with rings on the plates. You may like to place a flower on each plate,” says Vandana Sarawgi of SR Artefacts.,Opt for décor elements in contrasting colours. For instance, if your table is dark brown or black, go for décor items in gold or brass. For tables in white wood, choose elements in bold hues like red, yellow or blue. For a traditional dark wood dining table, choose a long maroon ikkat print table runner and adorn it with brass décor elements. For a contemporary dining table in light brown wood or white wood, opt for a short table runner in pastel colours.,Do it yourself,Get creative. Place small aromatic candles in mason jars and embellish the jars with macramé covers for warm, cozy vibes. “Fill a transparent vase with sticks or branches dipped in peppy colours. Wrap these sticks with string lights to add radiance to the space. If you have extra ceramic mugs, paint these in bright colours and intriguing designs to create statement décor pieces. Bring out empty wine or champagne bottles and splash some vibrant colours on them with a toothbrush,” suggests Saloni Khosla of Pepperfry. ","Sep 13, 2020

"Jagvir Goyal,Many apartments often don’t provide wire mesh shutters on doorways and windows. A look at why these are so important:,Weatherwise: Unlike independent houses, doorways to balconies in apartments are mostly provided with uPVC or aluminium panels with part-fixed glazing and part-sliding glazed shutters to step into the balcony. No wire mesh shutters are, generally, provided in the openable part which is highly desirable during summers.,Post-construction: Wire mesh shutters can be provided to the existing glazed windows without much fuss. Their provision demands addition of a new frame abutting the existing frame on the outer side of existing frame and inducting a prefabricated wire mesh shutter into it.,Material: In case of uPVC (un-plasticised poly vinyl chloride) windows, the supplier will check the sizes and bring factory-made windows for their provision at site. The aluminium frame consists of heavy powder-coated aluminium section. The frame sections, cut to size, are brought to site, screwed together and fitted in position by driving 5 inch screws through them into the walls. The wire mesh shutter has a 2.5 to 3 inch wide frame with galvanised wire mesh of 22 x 12 mesh tightly fixed in it.,Central support: It should be ensured that in wire mesh shutters, a horizontal central aluminium piece is provided to break the large-sized wire mesh panel for support. Else it’ll loosen after some time.,Smooth sliding, no play: Smooth sliding of wire mesh shutters should be repeatedly checked. These should run effortlessly. For this, brush lining is provided inside the sliding groove at top and bottom of shutter. Ensure that wire mesh shutter doesn’t interfere with the glass shutter or fixed glazed portion.,Locking arrangement: Wire mesh shutters should be provided with flush handles with locking arrangement like glazed-sliding shutters. Apartment dwellers can slide back the glass shutter with wire mesh shutters in locked position at night to allow fresh air inside, and yet feel secure.,Cost factor: The carpenter will take measurements, discuss material specifications and quote his rate of fabrication and site provision to you on per square feet basis. Normally, for a 3 BHK or 4 BHK apartment, provision of such additional shutters to all windows should cost around Rs50,000.","Sep 13, 2020

"Designers do not have a décor guide or rule book when it comes to decorating spaces. The design of each space is dealt with individually while honouring the context of the site and working in lines with the functional and aesthetical requirements. Having said that it is the designer touch which makes any dull and dated room turn into a welcoming and timeless interior volume. Herewith are some tips and tricks on how you can have your own Instagram-worthy living room, dining room, bedroom, kid’s room and more.,Living room: Find the focal point,The key to good design lies in a composed layout and proper layering of all elements of space. To get the décor of your living room right, look for potential areas where focal points can be achieved. A gallery of family photos or a huge artwork on the wall could take the décor of the room to a new level. Consider reupholstering the furniture and adding playful patterned cushions and a throw for a multi-layered, yet refined, appeal. Add an area rug, one that nods to the colour scheme of the upholstery and cushions. Top the space with table accessories or vases. Finally, introduce suitable indoor plants in pots and planters to enliven the setup. If you do not have a green thumb, dried flowers and potpourri could be the right fix.,Dining area: Try multiple patterns,The palette of the living room can act as a fair starting point to decorate the dining room since both the spaces ideally lie together in the home. The dining room is the right place to experiment with patterns, accessories and lighting. You can try accenting the space with multiples patterns in a similar colour or tone, creating an interesting tablescape with décor pieces of the same make, or bringing in a statement pendant light to crown the dining area. If the space and interior theme permits, you can install a coffee station or a bar trolley to effectuate a high-end allure to the space.,Bedroom: Create an intriguing backdrop,To amp up the décor of the bedroom and pull off a chic and relaxing aura, use the walls to create an intriguing backdrop. Paintings, floating shelves, mirrors, wall sconces can aid in building beautiful vignettes, while maintaining the style quotient of the room. Apart from that, you can invest in a colourful tapestry, rug or curtains to add warmth and personality to the space.,Kid’s bedroom: Punch in a dash of colour,An easy trick to design a lasting kids room is to pick up gender-neutral colours (like green, grey, beige, black and white) for the furnishing and built-in units. Blinds, bedcover, carpet, wall hangings, banners, etc. can be used to punch in a dash of colour to the room. Your child may also love unique additions like a teepee, a gallery wall full of his/her own drawings, a chalkboard wall, hanging fairy lights, etc.,Staircase: Install an engaging runner,A surefire way to build up the decor of the staircase area or stairwell is to install an engaging runner or add enhancements (like acrylic sheets, stick-on wallpapers) to the risers. The under-stair area and landing zones are a great place to place planters and figurines. If there is enough space, employ a couple of chairs or ottomans to tailor an intimate reading corner. Station a dramatic lighting fixture on the stairwell ceiling or wall to bring vertical interest. Wall hangings and wall art, too, can be situated as an instant solution too.","Sep 13, 2020

"Pooja Khanna Tyagi,A Basement renovation provides a wonderful opportunity to create extra space and incorporate some fun areas like a bar, den, home theatre or a gaming room. With careful planning, good lighting, proper selection of material and trendy decor ideas, one can transform the basement into a stunning space. Here are six things to consider if you plan to go for a full-fledged basement renovation.,Waterproof the basement,The first step is to check the basement for any leaks or dampness which can result in the growth of mould. If there are any sources of water penetration like cracks or leakages from the building pipelines, these should be rectified immediately.,Ensure good ventilation,Since there are fewer windows within the basement, one must ensure proper ventilation by incorporating exhaust fans. This is the best way to extract moist air from the basement and replace it with fresh air.,Create an elegant staircase,Design the staircase as an accent feature. Convert this area into a focal point by incorporating a floating staircase, use different material or colours to differentiate between the treads and the risers, install statement lights, go for built-in storage under the stair soffit and so on. Make sure that all window openings in the basement are big enough for one to climb out in case of a fire emergency if the staircase is inaccessible.,Go for a stylish decor,If you plan to use the basement as a bar or a gaming space, go for an open plan design with minimum walls. This will give the basement an airy look. Incorporate backlighting, contrasting colours, statement pieces of furniture, wall art, modern carpets and plush fabrics. Keep in mind that you cannot incorporate a bathroom in the basement as it is not permitted as per building bylaws. Alternately, create an audio-visual room by installing a screen, set of speakers, amplifiers, acoustic panels on the walls and ceiling, mood lighting and comfortable recliner chairs that combine together to create a stunning decor. Create a clutter-free and well-organised space by wall mounting the television and speakers.,Adequate lighting,Good lighting is a great way to enhance the overall look of the decor. Since most basements have limited access to natural light, it is essential to incorporate sufficient lighting with artificial lights. This can be achieved by creating a layered lighting scheme with a combination of ambient, task and accent lighting that makes the place warm and inviting.,Select sturdy material,Since most basements are prone to dampness, it is highly recommended to go for material that is maintenance free and won’t decay or disintegrate in the presence of moisture. Opt for sturdy materials like porcelain tiles, natural stone and moisture-resistant (MR) plywood. Avoid flooring material like laminated wood because it can swell and get damaged if there’s any moisture.","Sep 13, 2020

"Tribune News Service,Amritsar, September 11,The Partition Museum has remained shut since lockdown was announced in March this year, but it has opened its virtual space for visitors who want to sneak a peek into the pages of history. The one-of-its kind museum in the world has been running several educational programmes since its inception and its archives had only been accessed through visits to the heritage place, until the pandemic stuck. Its virtual galleries and tours have made an attempt to find audience across the globe amid restrictions.,The museum had recently hosted first online art exhibition in collaboration with Art Alive Gallery, New Delhi. It showcased 26 exclusive works by 16 eminent and upcoming artists of India. The exhibition was received well and it featured several prominent artists from the time when partition happened.,Rajwinder Kaur, curator of the museum, said they had been receiving a great response from visitors on their online platforms, accessing their virtual archives and gallery. “We have been consistently uploading significant audio-visual archives on our Facebook and Instagram pages. We share links to access the virtual tours, specifically curated to focus on individual event or otherwise,” she said. Most of the links to these virtual tours or access to archives is specific in nature and is free for all. The visitors can access its oral history library and artefacts and art work through its official website. It also has videos of eyewitnesses’ accounts.,As a long term measure, the museum is also creating a permanent virtual gallery, work on which is under progress, that will have archived images from Partition, train massacre stories, videos, arts, paintings, real oral accounts of eyewitnesses and survivors.","Sep 12, 2020

"KHARIF harvesting operations are going to begin soon. Agricultural production is likely to surpass last year’s record production by 7-8%. The higher production inevitably puts downward pressure on market prices. The problem of low harvest prices has been compounded by the steep fall in the GDP growth rate in the first quarter of 2020-21; it will reduce overall demand for the agricultural produce. Hence, ensuring the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for farmers is a gigantic task.,There are huge imbalances in the MSP operations. Various states have diverse levels of implementation capabilities. Punjab and Haryana are historically in a better position to procure at the MSP than states like Bihar and Odisha. Paddy farmers in Punjab are able to sell at the MSP, while farmers in Bihar have to settle for prices below the MSP. The focus is on paddy and wheat, with negligible procurement of pulses, oilseeds and other crops at the MSP.,This discriminatory policy blocked crop diversification towards pulses and oilseeds and also led to the neglect of rain-fed areas, where pulses and oilseeds are grown. This resulted in a huge shortage of crops like oilseeds. India is importing 70% of domestic consumption of edible oils each year by spending about Rs 75,000 crore on foreign exchange. It is incurring huge losses in storing excessive stocks of paddy and wheat procured under the price support scheme.,Procuring excessive stocks is a waste of resources. Procurement operations are flawed in many ways — lack of awareness among farmers; lack of working capital with procurement agencies; lack of gunny bags; delayed payments to farmers; inadequate logistical arrangements like godowns, processing mills in the procuring areas; disposal of procured stocks.,NITI Aayog recently recommended to the Food Ministry to limit procurement of foodgrains to the level needed for distribution under social welfare schemes and maintenance of buffer. The FCI procured 115 million metric tonnes (MT) of foodgrains in crop year 2020, whereas the maximum buffer stock is fixed at 41.12 million MT.,To overcome these problems in foodgrain operations, the Centre introduced PM-AASHA (Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan) in 2018. This is in line with the broader objective of gradually replacing physical procurement with direct money transfer to farmers, wherever required. PM-AASHA has three sub-schemes: Price Support Scheme (PSS), Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS) and Private Procurement & Stockist Scheme (PPSS).,The PSS involves procurement by the government agency at the MSP from the farmers during the harvest period; it has been in operation for paddy and wheat for the past four decades. Under PM-AASHA, PSS is now broad-based to cover pulses, oilseeds and copra in addition to paddy and wheat. Under this scheme, the Centre will compensate the states for any losses in procurement operations up to 25 per cent of production.,Under the PDPS, farmers are paid the difference between the MSP and the modal price, without actual procurement. It is a more market-friendly and efficient method as it eliminates the logistic costs faced under PSS. It is more practical to implement in crops like pulses and oilseeds with scattered and thinly distributed production, where actual procurement is costly and not feasible.,Under the PPSS, private players can procure oilseeds at the MSP during the notified period in select markets, for which they would be paid a service charge not exceeding 15 per cent of the MSP. However, private participation has been limited so far.,States are free to choose between the sub-schemes, depending on local conditions. In the long run, PDPS has an edge over others. Price deficiency payment through direct money transfer can curb inefficiency and corruption in foodgrain operations and the benefits will reach farmers through the already built JAM (Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile) trinity.","Sep 14, 2020

"FOR years, the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system for crops has benefited farmers in north India through guaranteed income for their produce. No wonder the system is held sacrosanct by farmers, politicians and policy-makers in this region. Even the slightest attempt or talk of tinkering with the MSP meets with stiff resistance from the farmers and the politicians who rely on them for electoral support.,The nearly five-decade-old system of MSP has contributed to the country attaining food security — at least in the staple foodgrains — besides making agriculture economically sustainable for farmers. It has helped the country come a long way from the mid-1960s, when India did not have enough foodgrains to feed its then 49 crore population, and 10 million tonnes of foodgrains were imported from the US. “The MSP regime has proved to be very beneficial because it has spurred farmers to grow crops with a guaranteed price,” says BS Sidhu, Commissioner, Agriculture, Punjab.,Over the years, however, the increase in MSP announced by the Centre before each crop marketing season has been rather low. This has contributed to high rural indebtedness as input costs in agriculture keep rising and the MSP announced by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) is minimal, thus squeezing the income of farmers. Sidhu says the system of calculating the input costs while fixing the MSP requires a relook. “The farmer should be treated as a skilled worker and the capital cost of land should be included. This will make the MSP more remunerative,” he adds.,Besides this inherent weakness in the MSP model of capping the income of farmers, it has also led to regional disparities as the regime is successful only in states having a well-developed agricultural marketing system. In most states, the crops are not being bought at the MSP as FCI intervention there is minimal and focused largely on Punjab and Haryana. Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan, general secretary of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan), says the MSP regime is often targeted for helping farmers of only a few states and those that grow only wheat and paddy. “To ensure that it benefits all farmers, it should be made legally binding on all to buy crops at the announced MSP,” he adds.,Balbir Singh Rajewal, who heads another faction of the BKU, says not only should crops other than wheat and paddy be bought at the MSP, but government should also encourage the processing industry for these other crops. “Earlier, pulses like moong and urad were cultivated here and we had small dal polishing units in Jagraon. Farmers stopped growing these because against the MSP of Rs 6,000, they would get just Rs 2,500 per quintal. Farmers found these non-remunerative and stopped growing pulses, which also led to the closure of these polishing units,” he laments.,Umendra Dutt, executive director of Kheti Virasat Manch, says the monoculture supported by the MSP regime has led to the destruction of agricultural biodiversity and massive consumption of pesticides. “If buying of other crops at the MSP is ensured, we would become self-sufficient in all crops,” he says.,Noted agro-economist MS Sidhu says though the MSP regime is sacrosanct, there is a need to increase farmers’ income by making them move to non-farm activities along with farming. Also, he says, it is time for value addition in agriculture by promoting food processing.,With the MSP regime being primarily restricted to wheat and paddy, this has led to monoculture, where only crops having a buy-back guarantee are being cultivated by farmers. As a result, the country has ample stocks of wheat and rice, but has to frequently import pulses and oilseeds.","Sep 14, 2020

"“….living only for the moment, savouring the moon, the snow, the cherry blossoms, and the maple leaves, singing songs, drinking sake, and diverting oneself just in floating, unconcerned by the prospect of imminent poverty, buoyant and carefree, like a gourd carried along with the river current: this is what we call ukiyo.”,— Asai Ryoi, c. 1661,‘When I was 50 I had published a universe of designs, but all I have done before the age of 70 is not anything of great value. At 75, I’ll have learned something of the pattern of nature, of animals, of plants, of trees, birds, fish and insects. When I am 80, you will see real progress. At 90, I shall have cut my way deeply into the mystery of life itself. At 100 I shall be a marvellous artist. At 110, everything I create — a dot, a line — will jump to life as never before.’,— Katsushika Hokusai (1760-1849),A little short of 300 years ago, there emerged in Japan an art movement that changed the world of art nearly all over the world. Ukiyo-e, meaning, literally, ‘Pictures of the Floating World’, is what this movement aimed at producing, moving away from the rigid classicism of earlier Japanese works and submerging itself in the ordinary, hedonistic world of the common man in which Kabuki actors and seductive courtesans, tea-houses and entertainment parlours, wrestling heroes and famous romantic vistas, all moved about raucously. The word ukiyo, which came to be associated with the movement, had originally expressed the Buddhist idea of the transitory nature of life. But suddenly this rather sober, even pessimistic, notion was overturned. From meaning ‘transitory’, which life of course is, the emphasis shifted to ‘floating’, expressing an attitude of joie de vivre. This new visual world, created by some remarkably gifted artists, was brought into being in the form of woodblock prints, which made it possible for anyone with a bit of extra cash to move into a world of dazzling images. The movement took off like a blazing fire, and names of artists — like Hokusai, Hiroshige, Utamaro, Sharaku, among them — started becoming household names, even as their inexpensive woodblocks hung about, grew into posters, turned greeting cards, or wrapping paper, peppering home after home and street corner after street corner.,Mt. Fuji. Also by Hokusai, 1839.,I have written about ukiyo-e before, in this very column. The subject is seductive and what it leads to — in terms of exploring its complexities and measuring its impact on the world of art alone — can keep one occupied for a long, long time. It is possible to take just one artist alone and his work — the great Hokusai for instance: 30,000 works; obsessive concerns with single themes like Thirty Six Views of Mt. Fuji, and another 100 that followed; Remarkable Views of Bridges in Various Provinces; a single extraordinary work 180 meters in length; constant self-examination — and find it hard to emerge from it. It is equally possible at the same time to go across to Europe from Japan and see how electrifying and profound the impact produced by ukiyo-e prints was on artists who were to become icons of modern art in their own right — Monet, Degas, Renoir, Toulouse-Lautrec, among others — admiring these new flat colours, shadow-less surfaces, and dramatic angles, that were coming in from Japan. Volumes have been written, and the theme is not exhausted yet.,On another note, however. Against this background, I find myself asking whether in some strange, time-bending, way, we — all of us — are not part of a ‘Floating World’ too. Not floating, as Asai Ryoi described, merrily “like a gourd carried along with the river current”, nor like logs cut fresh from a forest and rushing downstream: now moving, now stuck briefly in some corner. But drifting; unaware of where we are headed. Or — even worse — aware but unable to do anything about it. Consider the world we are living in at any level: political, economic, social, cultural, above all, moral. It is sheer mayhem. There is no merriment in it, no celebratory noises do we hear except those bellowed out by mindless media or cash-rich corporations, in the name of entertainment. A virus rises and spreads from some unknown source, or lab perhaps, and begins to squeeze the world, holding it from its scrawny neck. A black man is choked to death by a white policeman in uniform, nation-wide protests and riots break out, and yet nothing, nothing truly, happens. Millions of migrant labourers/workers begin to trudge homewards, all possession, all jobs, all dignity, lost, and continue to hope for better days to come. In another corner of the world, men opposed to the establishment are administered slow doses of poison so as to neutralise them. A known terrorist organisation threatened to set the world on fire if its demands were not to be met and yet, despite all the efforts of the wide range of nations, it keeps expanding and ‘burning’. We are moved, but remain unable to move.,Intriguingly, or as a diversion perhaps, I look at some of the ukiyo-e images — mostly Hokusai — from time to time, and see in them things that tell us something or the other about our world of today, or about our mindsets. In the Great Wave off Kanagawa by Hokusai, “arguably the single most famous image in all Asian Art”, are caught some hapless little boats. We do not even see them at first, for so overpowering is the ‘noise’ we hear made by the roaring wave, drowning all other sounds and sights, but slowly we begin to see them: not one, but three, all but about to be submerged and swept. In The Suspension Bridge on the Border of Hida, where two figures are seen, precariously positioned with everything shaking and heaving under them while they take their rickety steps, we can almost see ourselves. When mindless young men fly a kite from a sharply sloping slate roof — Kite Flying from Rooftop — we nearly tumble ourselves. In Torii Kiyomitsu’s Acrobats, just about everything points to nothing else than showmanship, performance.,It is but rarely that we come upon a calming sight like A Boy Watching Mt. Fuji. The rest of it — if not in ukiyo-e, at least in our own lives and our ‘floating’ surroundings — is a world that is all leak and creek, pitch and roll, keel and tilt. Isn’t it?","Sep 13, 2020

"Awadh (mispronounced as Oudh by the British) derives from Ayodhya, seat of an ancient kingdom that dates back to the age of 16 Great Janapadas, four to five centuries before the birth of Christ. Lord Ram of Ayodhya is the divine hero of the epic Ramayana. And this, at times, distracts attention from the other sub-regions of Awadh.,Faizabad was the capital from where the nawabs of Awadh governed their principality till it was shifted to Lucknow. Its location allowed it to act as a confluence of diverse cultural streams — culinary and artistic. It reached its zenith when Wajid Ali Shah held court here and generously patronised arts and crafts. The city has always taken pride in its refined language, manners and hospitality, its learned scholars and talented poets. It has been described as the Paris of the Orient. What is today referred to as the syncretic Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb — shared heritage of composite culture — is the priceless legacy of Awadh.,The rich tapestry of Indo-Islamic culture in Awadh is woven with multi-hued strands. Kashmiri Pandits, Punjabi Khatris, Kayasthas and prabasi Bengalis, soldiers of fortune and members of nobility despatched from Delhi to govern — all have contributed to its mesmerising pattern.,The fabulous culinary gems of Awadh, exotic and aromatic delicacies, have dazzled the world but few realise that the cuisine of this region is inseparable from the fairs and festivals celebrated according to the cycle of seasons. These unveil the rich crafts tradition of the tract, stretching from Rohilkhand — encompassing Rampur, Amroha, Sambhal, Budaun, Shahjahanpur — to Kannauj, famed for its ittr, and along the banks of Yamuna through Farrukhabad, Firozabad and Agra. The footprint of Awadh is really large. And the beloved Ganga river, after embracing the Yamuna at Allahabad, moves on to Varanasi via Chunar and Mirzapur.,When one talks of the Awadh Archives, it envisions documenting, cataloguing and drawing from a rich repertoire of arts and crafts — chikankari and zardozi, pottery and perfumes, illustrated/illuminated manuscripts and calligraphy; from glassware in Firozabad to ittar ka karkhana (perfumeries) and handmade carpets in Mirzapur.,Photos courtesy: Osama Jalali,In cities and towns of Awadh, there has been a long tradition of cultivating language and literature, practising and patronising calligraphy.,Moving on,It is a matter of great satisfaction that the UP Sunni Waqf Board has decided to ‘move on’ and embark on the path of reconciliation. Only this mindset can ensure that sores are not allowed to fester dangerously. The land made available to it is around 5 acres, where a mosque will be built. The board has decided to set up an Indo-Islamic Cultural Centre on the premises that will house the Awadh Archives.,Perhaps, there is a need to remove some cobwebs. A mosque is primarily a place to offer ritual worship where the community congregates. But it is also a place that, like a temple, performs other functions such as providing education and doing charity. Madrasa and kharati dawakhana are also proposed to be built, along with the mosque.,One more thing. The archives and digital museum may be prefixed with Awadh but the domain of Indo-Islamic culture extends over all of India. Deccan had created its own Ganga-Jamuni heritage even before the establishment of the Mughal Empire. Hyderabad, under Quli Qutab Shah, illustrates this shared, cosmopolitan fusion of Persian, Turkic, Arab and Abyssinian influences. It was Dekhni-Hindavi that enriched Urdu with the passage of time.,Food and architecture, crafts and literature, all flourished under the Nizams and Sultans of Bidar, Bijapur and Ahmednagar, who asserted their sovereignty after the dissolution of the Bahmani Empire. What can’t be forgotten is the Deccan’s Awadhi connection. The Nizam sent from Delhi was, before this, a Subedar in Awadh. He carried with him memories of Faizabad and more. But let us not digress.,Discovering lost riches,Time to return to Awadh, not just Lucknow and its legendary taluqas — Mehmudabad, Jehagirabad, Kotwara, Balrampur and many more. They take justifiable pride in nurturing and protecting the ‘sajha virasat’ but it’s time we turned our gaze to the countryside — that is where the master chefs and craftspersons came from, bringing with them the flavours and fragrances of their beloved villages. The element of folk and provencal in Awadh has never been less remarkable than the haute in the courts.,What can be more satisfying than discovering the lost riches — objects of art such as brassware from Moradabad, made-to-measure sherwani and achhakan from Aligarh, blue pottery from Chinhat, juxtaposed with carafes, chandeliers from Firozabad — and share the agony and ecstasy of their making with visitors to the archives.,True, the space will be limited, and there may be paucity of funds. This is where digital technology offers unprecedented creative opportunities. From calligraphy to abstract designs to 3D virtual tours of the majestic mosques in India — Sunheri and Atala Masjid in Jaunpur, Taj ul Masjid (Bhopal) and the ancient wooden mosque in Kerala will help the pilgrims and tourists to appreciate the evolution of mosque architecture in India. Its essential features — minaret and dome(s), open courtyard with a pulpit — will be interestingly explained. The arches and domes were incorporated in other religious and secular buildings with passage of time — in the gurdwaras in Punjab and palaces and cenotaphs in Rajasthan and Bundelkhand.,Awadh Archives, in short, will strive to provide a portal to view the gallery of Indo-Islamic culture. The digital displays will facilitate the visitor to appreciate much better the processes of carpet weaving, glassware manufacture and gold embroidery. Handicrafts on the verge of extinction such as beating tiny sheets of silver and gold into wafer-thin foil/leaves and handmade pottery will also get a fresh lease of life.,From the kitchen shelf,Most people have naturally asked enough questions about the food that will be available in the community cafeteria. It is not conceived as langar in a Sufi dargah or in a gurdwara. The objective is to provide hygienic, nutritious, pocket-friendly light meals and snacks representing the variety of popular dishes — many forgotten — from different sub-regions of Awadh.,The Waqf Board being a charitable non-profit organisation will hopefully try to keep the prices low, but it’s unreasonable to expect subsidised meals. For the project to be viable, the kitchen must recover food and other fixed costs. The province is renowned for master chefs and what is proposed is to conduct training classes in basic kitchen craft under their supervision to create livelihood and self-employment for young adults and school dropouts in Faizabad and adjacent areas. It may be possible to take advantages of synergies provided by Hunar Se Rozgar Tak or Kaushal schemes of the government and attract some support under the Corporate Social Responsibility programme.","Sep 13, 2020

"Charanjit Singh Teja,Tribune News Service,Amritsar, September 15,The historic Akali Market which was once one of the most visited places in the holy city lies in utter neglect now.,The market was constructed in the 1930s to generate revenue for the Akal Takht.,A triple-storey ‘deodhi’ in the chowk of Paparan Walla and Misri Bazaar, still manages to attract visitors, but the inside picture of the market and the Bagh is disappointing.,A few metres away from the Darbar Sahib complex, the market has over 100 shops and most of the traders deal with the iron and steel. Both the market and Bagh Akalian are neglected by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), which is the custodian of the property. Shopkeepers alleged that the SGPC wants to get rid of from the 90-year-old tenants to fulfill its desire to construct inns and rest houses.,Shopkeeper in the market claimed that the place used to have a glorious past.,Shopkeepers claim that roads outside the shops remain filled with the debris and garbage. There are no arrangements to drain out the rain water, they said.,Before the annexation of Punjab by Britishers, the city was known for its beautiful gardens and ponds. Anand Gabha, in her book “Amritsar, a study in Urban History”, mentioned that Bagh Akalia was attached to Akal Bunga (Akal Takht). The Bagh was one of the most prominent gardens in the city. It was also shown in the map of 1849 prepared by the British administration. The Bagh was developed in the Misl period and later renowned Sikh warrior Akali Phoola Singh used to take care of it. Later, the garden became the assembling point for the Akalis activists, who used to take part in the ‘morchas’ (political movement against British rule) during the early nineteenth century.,After taking possession of gurdwaras from mahants in 1920, the SGPC was formed to manage historical Sikh shrines in the country. The Bagh Akalian belonged to the Akal Takhat. Dr Joginder Singh, a historian and former head of history department, Guru Nanak Dev University, says: “There were not many income resources to gurdwaras soon after the Akalis took possession from the mahants. Then, Akal Takhat Jathedar Mohan Singh Nagoke took the initiative and constructed a big market in Bagh Akalaian in the late 1930s.”,The SGPC is making efforts to construct a multi-storey inn with a parking facility adjoining the Bagh Akalain but to no avail. On April 23, SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal again laid the foundation stone of the Mata Tripta Niwas, which has been dedicated to the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev. Spread in an area of five acres, the new inn with 1,000 rooms has been proposed in the market. Earlier, the SGPC kept an amount of Rs10 crore in the 2018-2019 budget to carry out the first phase of the project but it could not take off as a dispute arose with tenants who had moved court.,Vaid Parvesh Kumar, a tenant at shop number 1 at main Deohri,Joginder Singh (80), an iron wire trader in the market","Sep 16, 2020

"Navnee Likhi,British-American filmmaker Christopher Nolan’s staggeringly ambitious, brain-bender sci-fi thriller Tenet is about a CIA secret agent, who must manipulate the flow of time in order to prevent World War III. John David Washington, referred to as the Protagonist in the film, is told to head a secret organisation called Tenet. John meets Laura, a scientist who studies bullets. Laura’s entropy has been inverted so that they can move back in time. The Protagonist traces the bullets to Priya Singh, an arms dealer residing in Mumbai. When the Protagonist meets Priya (played by Dimple Kapadia), she tells him that the bullets had been supplied by Russian agent Andrei Sator, a megalomaniac villain. The Protagonist recruits funny and affable British agent Neil.,The film opens with the Protagonist participating in an undercover SWAT operation at an opera house, where he has to rescue a spy and capture an artefact. The spy is rescued but the Protagonist is captured and tortured before he consumes a cyanide pill. He wakes up to learn that the pill works to camouflage the mission and fake it as a mock exercise. The succeeding scenes unfold in Italy, London, Mumbai, besides many exotic Scandinavian and Baltic locales. The men on mission are shown journeying in-and-out of these countries and also moving around in dusty battlefields where time moves back and forth.,As the mission progresses, the Protagonist and his partner Neil meet Sator’s estranged wife, Kat, who is desperate to rescue her child from her husband’s clutches. Kat tells them that Sator was blackmailing her with regard to a fake artefact which she had sold through him. The Protagonist and Neil meet Sator, who tells them that he has the artefact, which was part of the future-developed algorithm, capable of destroying the world.,Kat tells the Tenet team that Sator was suffering from cancer and he would trigger the algorithm before committing suicide soon. Kat goes back in time to delay Sator’s death while the Tenet team tracks the assembled algorithm to an abandoned Soviet city.,The film is a glossy global espionage adventure showing frantic car chases, brutal restaurant kitchen fights, besides bungee jump from a Mumbai skyscraper. It is exciting to see buildings crumble and reassemble immediately afterwards. The complexities added to the time-travel techniques over the course of film are mind-boggling. Tenet doesn’t really give you the time to understand the plot of the film as there are secrets to be unearthed and puzzling mysteries solved.,Ludwig Goransson’s background score is fascinating. Cinematography by Dutch Hoyter Van Hoytema is enthralling with stunning visuals. Dimple Kapadia’s presence in the role of arms dealer Priya gives goosebumps. John David Washington capably weaves charm and swagger around the character’s no-nonsense ire while Robert Pattinson is convincing in the role of Neil.","Sep 20, 2020

"THE robustness of Indian agriculture ensured that there was no food crisis during the over two-month-long lockdown due to Covid-19. Rather, India decided to feed the majority of its population free of cost till November 2020, and can do so for another one-and-a-half years even if there is no food production — thanks to the agricultural scientists, farmers and other stakeholders who are part of the Indian food and agriculture system. The Covid-19 pandemic has forced us to reorient our system so that the country always remains food-secure. Being one of the most populous nations in the world, India needs a food system so robust and renewable that even if another pandemic occurs, the impact on the economy in general and this system in particular is minimal.,In terms of food and agriculture, some Indian states are considered to be consumers while others are suppliers. The consuming states are mostly suppliers of labour to the producing states not only for agriculture, but also for labour-intensive industries. Normally, the supply of labour is from states with less economic activity to those with high economic activity. Although accurate data is hard to obtain, the Union Labour Ministry’s statistics put the number of migrant labourers in India at over 4 crore. As per Census 2011, the number of internal migrants in the country was 13.9 crore. However, this number also includes women who migrate due to marriage or with their migrant husbands. UP, Bihar, MP, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Odisha and the North East contribute the maximum migrants. Covid-19 triggered the reverse exodus of lakhs of labourers from work sites. According to one estimate, nearly 60 lakh migrant workers were seen crossing state borders during the pandemic. This frantic march of labourers towards their home states was mainly due to the fear that most of them would run out of food before the end of the lockdown. In addition, over 90 per cent of them had already lost one to three weeks of work, which caused financial insecurity too.,Though the overall supply situation and the prices of essential food items did not appear too worrisome, in the longer run, adverse effects were seen in six cases. One, the upheaval affected harvesting, collection and marketing of foodgrains, fruits and vegetables at the farm level. Two, the fall in the prices of a range of commodities in agriculture. Three, if the return of migrant workers back to their workplaces does not happen even partially, agricultural and industrial operations are not going to gather pace, and thus a huge impact on economic growth may be seen in the near future. While some operations in selected areas may be done using machines and tools, the local shortage of machines or its hiring centres, repair shops and spare parts is affecting the activities, leading to many machines lying unused. Labour shortage was also being experienced in most milk processing plants, cold storages and warehouses. Four, supply chains were disrupted across the country for a range of commodities, causing huge post-harvest losses even at the supplier’s level.,Five, the youth, even in rural areas, do not want to work in the agricultural fields. It is difficult to find labourers for farm operations even in villages. In the longer run, the country is going to face a labour crunch in agricultural and industrial sectors. Six, our cultivable land and water availability are shrinking, but we will have to feed a population that is estimated to reach 1.7 billion by 2050 under adversely changed climatic conditions. Policy-makers have to think of ways and means to tackle these situations on an immediate and long-term basis.,During his interaction with sarpanches on Panchayati Raj Day (April 24) this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the Covid-19 situation had taught us to be self-reliant. Every district and panchayat have to become self-reliant for ushering in Atmanirbhar Bharat. The mismatch of economic activities of different states and different districts within states has to be addressed. For labour-surplus states, we have to create agricultural/rural raw material-based industries so that farmers or their dependents don’t depend solely on agricultural activities. Each family must have at least one or two members doing a salaried job, while states having labour shortage may go towards fully mechanised precision agriculture and post-harvest activities, and online marketing systems. Indian agriculture now requires a major emphasis on agricultural engineering and post-harvest processing.,In labour-surplus states, we need to set up Intensive Economic Zones with agro-processing centres (APCs). One APC with an investment of about Rs 30-40 lakh can give direct employment to 4-6 persons with a net profit of up to Rs 1 lakh per month. If so, we also need to establish storage godowns at the panchayat level (which will help in reducing grain movement during the pandemic), food quality testing laboratories, a market yard for selling locally and in the open market through digital platforms. Farm machinery and post-harvest equipment custom-hiring centres, equipment repair and service centres etc. may come up in these areas and create jobs. If one such APC is established in each village, labour movement may get considerably reduced. No one wants to leave his birthplace if his basic requirements are met locally. We have to generate work for a majority of the people as an additional source of income.,In labour-deficient states, we need to lay emphasis on mechanisation. Efforts have to be made to use robotics not only for agricultural operations for foodgrains but also for fruits and vegetables. The Internet of Things, machine vision system, deep machine learning, sensor-based maturity, harvesting and ripening stage determination with big data analytics and decision-making system need to be developed for Indian agriculture.,The world now needs to be ready to face a Covid-like situation on the agriculture and food front too. Generally also, we need to cut down on the use of land, labour, water and fertilisers. World Food Prize winner Dr Rattan Lal has rightly said: “We need to reduce land under cereal crops, and water used for irrigation has to be brought down by one-third.” So, we have to find alternative ways of producing more food. The nation which will be able to fill the bellies of its citizens while preserving its natural resources will be the winner. For such a situation, we have to start working on developing engineered food (manufacturing food in factories without cultivation). Processes and machinery have to be developed to convert any biomaterial, weeds, grass, fallen leaves, tree barks and crop residue into food for humans. An interdisciplinary platform comprising agricultural engineering, electronics, computer applications, robotics, chemistry etc. should be established to achieve this long-term goal and for tackling pandemics and climate change. If we will not start now, some other will surely do, and we will be left behind.","Aug 24, 2020

"Breads are a staple at every meal and while curries have seen much change, the bread was somehow always left behind. This now seems set to change as chefs are experimenting with innovative fillings and grains to ensure that flat breads become interesting and tasty. As India unlocks, it might be a good time to indulge and try out these flavours.,The twists are many — strange yet mouth-watering. Don’t be surprised if you encounter a tandoori ragi ka masaledar nanza, makhmali pudina and rosemary paratha, chukandari worki paratha and thyme charcoal bharwan chicken baida roti on the menu. There are breads with combinations like keema matar, chicken liver and paneer makhani. If the traditional stuff like tikoni khamiri roti, Baluchi kulcha and Kashmiri kulcha is available, there is olive chilli garlic naan, cooked with black and green olives and brushed with virgin olive oil, for those who have a liking for Italian flavours.,Breads are normally made from white flour and are thus heavy on the stomach. To change that, restaurants are making use of healthy ingredients. The base flour now has multigrain variants and there is a focus on flours derived from millets such as ragi, bajra and jowar, water chestnut (sinhgara) and chickpeas. Sandeep Choudhary, executive chef at Ibis, New Delhi, says their innovative offers like veggie-packed, naturally gluten-free and grain-free cauliflower flatbread have been a hit among sportspersons.,Guests are driving change too.

"Vandana Aggarwal,Once seen as a fancy add-on at expensive restaurants, micro-greens have gained popularity as a superfood that can be grown cost-effectively, with minimum supplies at home. Often confused with sprouts which are eaten once the seeds germinate, microgreens are the next step in plant growth. These are harvested after the germinated seeds develop tiny leaves and roots.,Don’t fret if you live in a small flat with no garden. Microgreens need little space to grow and if you have a windowsill or balcony that catches a couple of hours of daily sunshine, you are good to go. Though some taste better than others, seeds of almost all edible plants can be grown as microgreens. It’s a good idea to start with familiar and easy-to-grow seeds.,Choosing and preparing the seeds: Take about half a cup of larger seeds like green beans or dry peas. If using smaller seeds like mustard or fenugreek, two tablespoon’s are enough. Rinse gently and soak. Keep covered in a dark place for at least 24 hours, changing the water once in between.,Green beans in a kettle: Green beans or moong is the most popular, the fastest and easiest to grow. Soak in a kettle to start with. After 24 hours, rinse and allow all the water to drain out of the spout. Cover and keep on the kitchen counter. Moong doesn’t require much sunshine. Rinse at least two or three times a day. Your microgreens will be ready within 3-4 days. They will be white and plump. Alternately if you grow these in soil or expose these to sunlight, these will be green but will take longer to mature.,: Mustard greens are small and delicate but have a distinctive wasabi flavour that adds a zing to your palate. Spread a cotton cloth in a sieve and gently transfer the soaked seeds onto the cloth. Spray with water to keep the cloth moist at all times. These seeds love partial sunlight and take five to seven days to grow. Harvest by gently pulling out plants to separate them from the cloth.,: Use a fruit tray which has holes (for excess water to drain out) and half fill with potting mix. Spread the soaked peas in a single layer. Spray with water and press down with another plastic tray. Cover with a cloth to keep the light out and moisture in. Once sprouts emerge, keep the container in a sunny spot and continue watering at least twice a day. Harvest the shoots in about two weeks, by cutting just above the soil line.,Microgreens taste best when fresh but can be safely refrigerated in a plastic bag for a couple of days. Use the tender and edible greens as a nutritious side dish, delicious and anti-oxidant addition to smoothies or a colourful topping to salads.,Enjoy this fresh produce grown organically in your kitchen.","Aug 30, 2020

"Jagvir Goyal,Most house builders begin construction of the house with much energy and enthusiasm but by the time of completion, they often get exhausted. Yet the carpenters and painters seem to never finish their jobs while few others wait to install the pending fittings and give final touches to the house. Taking care of the following can help you expedite the construction:,Once you hire the services of an architect, immediately finalise the house plans. Be clear about your preferences like the storeys of the house, provision of basement, a side passage, number of bedrooms, etc.,Once the house plans are finalised, get these approved from the local authority. Ask the architect to ensure that the plans comply with the building bye laws. Hiring the services of architects on approved panel list of the local body makes the task easy. Get permission for water supply and sewerage connections.,Prepare material estimates on the basis of plan and elevation of the house. Estimate the quantity of bricks, cement, steel, wood, sand and coarse aggregate (bajri). For rough estimation and cost involved of these six materials, thumb rules can be applied.,Go for reputed brands of cement and steel. Choose a dealer supplying fresh lots of cement. Survey the brick kilns around, examine the ready lots and finalise your bricks supplier. For supply of steel, ensure that steel bars are IS marked. Go for straight bars instead of coils, which demand extra time and labour. Look for fresh, rust-free steel. Both sand and bajri are normally supplied by one dealer. Keep cross-checking the rates being charged. It pays dividends to timely engage suitable labour contractor to raise structure of the house.,Once the construction is started, buy the required quantity of wood, get it cut to major sizes and store it as per prescribed methods for air circulation among the cut pieces for natural seasoning. Choose wood carefully. Natural drying and seasoning of wood minimises chances of its warping after use. Carpenters are the last to leave the house. Get electric connection where carpenters can work independently to assemble door and window frames and shutters and later to shift them to site.,Choose floor tiles instead of marble to save time required for grinding and polishing of marble. Go for wood laminates to save time lost in wood polishing. PoP work for ceilings saves much time than required for false ceiling which needs fixing of GI hangers.","Aug 30, 2020

"Neha Saini,For a Michelin star chef who has served the likes of Barack Obama, Dalai Lama, Queen Elizabeth, Vikas Khanna’s favourite food — the humble, home-cooked dal-chawal — is a reminder of the man’s modest lifestyle. “He can eat dal-chawal seven days a week. It’s his all-time favourite, ever since he was a child,” says his mother, Bindu Khanna (70), based in Amritsar.,According to Bindu, “Our backyard was host to several impromptu feasts as Vikas’ friends and neighborhood kids would gather around and he’d cook for them. Many times, a few of our neighbours would call him to taste a new recipe they tried at home. He was fondly called ‘pandat’ by one of our neighbours because he was a simple, sorted kid, ready to help everyone.”,His elder brother Nishant, an educator, agrees. “As a kid, Vikas was always empathetic, feeding strays, birds and the needy. For many, what he is doing now might be a new concept but growing up in Amritsar, we always learnt to share our graces.”,Not the brightest of kids in school, his mother recalls how Vikas would spend most of his time after school cooking, along with his beeji (grandmother). “Vikku,” as his mother fondly calls him, “was always sentimental and inclined towards creativity. He was different from other kids as he was always doing chores that people at that time did not deem fit for a boy. He learnt knitting from his grandmother and would make sweaters. He learnt sculpting and would do wooden sculptures. A wooden Ganesha that he made is still displayed at Salaam Bombay, an upscale restaurant in New York where he worked.” He was born to beat the odds, she says. “Even when he started Lawrence Garden Kitchens, his small catering business, from our home, many doubted his choice of career as it was not seen as a respectable line of work. When he told me about his decision to become a chef, I too was a bit taken aback. I asked him — “Kya tu abb bawarchi banega?”,The first time, says his mother, her son’s culinary skills stunned her was when he cooked bhindi for her. “It was the best bhindi I had ever tasted, Vikas was seven or eight years old that time and I knew then that he would go places.”,His passion for food and service came from his beeji. In his ancestral home, his room was close to beeji’s room and both of them would spend hours in the kitchen, where Vikas would watch her cook.,Bindu says that he still misses his grandmother, who was one of the most influential persons in his life. ‘Beeji passed away in 2013, and two years later, his father passed away.

"Pooja Khanna Tyagi,If you have a small bathroom, it is essential to create a well-organised layout which has provision for the storage of toiletries and other essentials. Here are some features which can be incorporated within the decor of the bathroom to create a highly functional and aesthetically pleasing space:,These units comprise a mirror unit with narrow storage. A great way to keep the clutter out of sight, the cabinets, also called medicine cabinet, can be used to store essential bathroom items, medicines and toiletries.,Strategically divide the bathroom into a wet and dry area with a shower curtain. You can also create a walk-in shower area with a frameless glass partition as it provides an unobstructed view. It also lets light pass and gives the bathroom a visually larger look.,Consider a floating vanity which incorporates a cabinet below the sink as it clears the floors space and makes the bathroom appear bigger. If there is a space constraint, install a pedestal sink or corner sink.,Make provision for a wall-mounted commode, instead of a floor-mounted one, as it takes lesser space and imparts a sleeker look.,If the bathroom is tight on space, go for a sliding door or pocket door so that you can make use of precious floor space. Alternately you can open the bathroom swing door in the outward direction instead of opening it inwards.,If there is no space to hang towel rods on the bathroom walls, install these on the back of the door but make sure that the depth of the towel rod is not more than that of the door knob. One can also screw a towel hook behind the door.,Make optimum use of the bathroom corners by installing corner shelves. These can be efficiently used for storing and displaying toiletries.,Make maximum use of the vertical space by making provision for open or closed storage above the bathroom door so that it is out of sight and does not look imposing. Incorporate built-in storage within the bathroom niches and install sleek floating shelves on the walls.","Aug 30, 2020

"Once the monsoon recedes, humidity level goes down considerably in September and there’s a drop in the night temperature. This is the time to prepare the planting of winter annuals. Here’s how to go about it: The nursery beds are made 15-20 cm high and 60-90 cm wide under partial sunlight. The nursery medium is prepared by thoroughly mixing one part each of garden soil, river sand and leaf mould. Drench this with 0.2 per cent Bavistin to take care of soil-borne diseases. Depending on the seed size, sow these at a depth of 0.5-1 cm and cover. Maintain moisture levels but there should be no water logging. As the seeds germinate, uncover to do thinning and separation of lumps. When 3-4 leaves appear, reduce watering and expose them to sun for few days. In the evening hours, using a narrow blade, loosen the soil. Holding its leaves, gently pull the seedling with soil intact and plant into flowerbeds.,For the flowerbeds: Prepare levelled, inch-deep well-drained flowerbeds in a sunny location. Clear the weeds and dig to expose in sun for a week. Mix 5 kg of farmyard manure and 500 gm DAP in 100 sq ft area (10’x 10’).,When mixing the annuals, keep in mind not only the colour but the foliage and texture also. Do not plant these in stiff rows but in clumps or groups. Petunia colour tones present an excellent monochromatic approach. For vertical effect, use larkspur, lupin or snap dragon. To generate mass effect, plant annuals in proportionate volume with synchronised flowering. These can be in a single colour or in harmony with complimenting texture. Some varieties that can be grown are acroclinum, African marigold, antirrhinum, brachycome, calendula, California poppy, China aster, cineraria, cosmos, dahlia, dimorphotheca, French marigold, gypsophila, kale, lupin, nasturtium, nemesia, sweet sultan, Sweet William, stock, salvia and wall flower. To add colour and softness in the rockery, plant Alyssum (sweet), Brachycome, phlox and nasturtium. Flowers like antirrhinum, alyssum, petunia, stock, sweet peas, sweet sultan and wall flower will fill the air with fragrance.,Compact low-growing annual ties the flowerbed into a large identity. When planted along pathways, these soften the hardness and straight lines of the building. Sweet alyssum, ibris (candytuft), ice plant, brachycome, dianthus dwarf are some options.,Fast-growing holly hock, larkspur, peas (using support) make excellent screening plants to demarcate or make temporary division or partition. Lady’s lace gives good effect when sown against herbaceous border.,Low-growing annuals are the best for pots. As a basic consideration, a fully grown plant should be more than 1½ times the size of pot. Bellis perennis, brachycome, pansy, kale, dahlia, sweet William, carnation, pink, matricaria, gazania, lupin, ice plant, nemesia, petunia, salvia, cineraria, nasturtium and pansy are successful pot plants.,Best suited for interiors are cut flowers like acroclinium, Lady’ lace, amobium alatum, antirrhinum, calendula, callistephus chinensis (Aster), centaurea, (corn flower), larkspur, dianthius caryophyllus (carnation), dianthius barbatus (sweet William), gerbera, gypsophila, helichrysum, iberis, mathhiola incana (stock), bells of Ireland with long and hard stem have long bloom.,A colour at an eye level is best offered by low growing and trailing varieties of petunia, geranium, verbena and nasturtium.","Aug 30, 2020

"THE Centre’s move to ban 27 widely used pesticides (12 insecticides, eight fungicides and seven herbicides) may have little immediate impact on agriculture and farmers. As of now, a draft order has been issued, banning the manufacturing and sale of these pesticides on the grounds of the risk they pose to humans and animals.,These pesticides are used on almost all crops — paddy, wheat, maize, sugarcane and cotton, besides vegetables and fruits. A large number of countries have already banned these pesticides and the Union government is under pressure from environmentalists to ban these in India. The debate, however, now centres around the alternatives available to farmers, and also whether these alternatives are economically viable for farmers, already reeling under ever-increasing input costs and low price realisation for their produce. There are no alternatives available in the market for at least one-third of these pesticides. As an alternative to pesticides, Punjab has been promoting Integrated Pest Management (IPM) techniques to control pests.,“Eh dawaiyan di varton saadi majboori hai... nahin tan sari fasal kharab ho jaoo. If the substitutes are available, and that too at a reasonable price, farmers will opt for the same. But from what we hear, the alternatives are almost double the cost of these pesticides proposed to be banned. Also, where is the guarantee that the substitutes are disease-resistant and will ensure that the yield of the crop remains as high as with the use of these 27 pesticides,” says farmer activist Randeep Singh of Sangrur district.,Pesticide use is among the highest in Punjab, after Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. Though Punjab has a much smaller area, its pesticide usage accounts for almost eight per cent of the national figure. Almost 4,930 metric tonnes (MT) of chemical pesticides were used in the state in 2019-20, as per figures available from the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare. According to the Punjab Farmers and Farm Workers’ Commission, the state has seen a steady decline in the use of chemical pesticides. Punjab used 5,689 MT of chemical pesticides in 2014-15 and 5,543 MT in 2018-19.,Ajay Vir Jakhar, chairman of the Commission, says that the draft agriculture policy for Punjab clearly defines that the pesticide usage is to be reduced by 10 per cent each year. “Through counselling and other agriculture extension activities, we are gaining success and cutting down on pesticide usage for the past three years. A ban will not make these 27 pesticides vanish from the markets as huge stockpiles are being created by manufacturers and dealers. The shift to safer and cheaper alternatives will take time as the agriculture research system is not geared for it and is only offering chemical alternatives,” he says.,Baljit Singh, a farmer of Jatana Khurd in Mansa district, says the government should look at supplying the substitutes at reasonable prices through cooperative societies. “It will build trust and farmers will opt for the safer pesticides faster,” he says, adding that quality control and regular monitoring of the efficacy of substitutes would also help boost farmers’ confidence.,Farmer activist Ramandeep Singh Mann feels that the ban on pesticides, without viable substitutes, could gravely impact the farm economy. “All substitutes should be thoroughly examined, researched and experimented with before the farmers are asked to shift to these. The shift has to be gradual, so a complete immediate ban may not be in the best interests of all stakeholders,” he says.,Pesticide use is among the highest in Punjab, after Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. The state accounts for almost 8% of the national usage. Almost 4,930 metric tonnes (MT) of chemical pesticides were used in the state in 2019-20, down from 5,543 MT in 2018-19. The state’s target is to reduce usage by 10% every year.","Aug 31, 2020

"Renu Sud Sinha,In another two days, Feed India Initiative will have completed five months of its tenacious journey of feeding millions in more than 135 cities across India during the pandemic. The man spearheading this campaign is New York-based Vikas Khanna, a Michelin-starred chef for the world, but a humble man at heart from ‘Guru ki Nagri’ Amritsar.,The campaign has crossed the 30 million-meal (cooked and dry ration) mark, but food is not the only thing Vikas and his team of volunteers are providing. Also on the list are 400,000 slippers, 3 million sanitary pads and 2 million masks. While he’s been too busy to calculate the overall cost, “on a rough estimate, it should be around $10 million”, says Vikas. The campaign, however, has zero-administrative cost, as it is being managed by a team of 60 volunteers, in India and the US.,From his house in Manhattan, he shares an interesting anecdote that led to the foundation of this vast effort. In March-end, he received a mail from an old-age home in India, seeking donation for its inmates, stuck during the lockdown. He immediately transferred some money, but the mail turned out to be a spam. However, it set him thinking about the plight of the less fortunate during the pandemic. Having been associated with such endeavours before, he was aware that most orphanages, old-age homes, and other such institutes run from month to month in terms of rations, donations, etc, and would be hugely affected by the pandemic. And that’s how the idea of Feed India came into being.,Feed India, or Barkat as he calls it, started with a single tweet on April 1. Vikas asked his 2.3 million followers on Twitter to go to their neighbourhood orphanages, old-age homes, leprosy centres and check if the inmates needed ration or food.,Soon, the messages grew faster than the Covid cases across India, and he and his volunteers were quick to respond.,A basic kit of essentials, including hygiene essentials, was put together. Each bag consisted of ration items, essential supplies, sanitisers, sanitary napkins, detergent and sometimes even chocolate, along with slippers, water bottles, etc.,From institutes of destitution, his campaign soon extended to migrants walking home, street vendors, Mumbai’s dabbawalas, boatmen and craftsmen in Varanasi, inmates of widow ashrams, people with disabilities, transgenders, sex workers, AIDS patients, anyone and everyone in need.,As Vikas was managing everything from the US, there were some logistical issues — unscrupulous vendors, dishonest suppliers, vanishing supply trucks, payments that had to be paid twice. He almost gave up but his mother — the anchor who keeps him rooted, as he puts it — reminded him how having achieved his dream of becoming a top chef despite odds, he could not be scared of these little singes.,He reached out to the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) in mid-April. By then, the NDRF had already been working with the pandemic-affected in different states.,But didn’t the NDRF find the proposal of a celebrity chef sitting across oceans a little farfetched? Says Satya Narayan Pradhan, Director-General of the NDRF, “His commitment, authenticity and straight-forwardness came across loud and clear. And this partnership has moved from strength to strength because of the synergy in sincerity from both sides.”,Vikas has spent millions from his own funds to kickstart the campaign and keep it going. Collaborations, in both cash and kind, with brands came much later. India Gate rice management was the first to approach him in mid-April. Since then, there have more than 50 Indian and international collaborators, including Tata, Procter & Gamble, Paytm, Patanjali, etc. The latest on board is Crown Rice. It has committed 1 lakh kg of rice for Feed India’s Ganesh Chaturthi prasadam drive in Mumbai on September 1.,Many individuals have also pitched in, including artist and architect Tarik Currimbhoy, Sandie Tillotson (NuSkin), Heather Ibrahim-Leathers (Global Fund for Widows), social entrepreneur Payal Tulsiyan, and of course, the man of the moment, Sonu Sood. The two Punjabi boys came together to help migrants reach home — Sonu was taking care of transportation and Vikas was providing them with meals on the way. For this initiative, Vikas had come up with an innovative plan. He reached out to Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited and converted at least 100 fuel stations on the highways of UP, MP and Maharashtra into kitchens from where the weary migrants could have a hot meal on the go.,The one lesson from the pandemic, says Vikas, has been the “resilience of mankind and its solidarity”.,With the end of the pandemic nowhere in sight, how long can he sustain Feed India? “I signed two book deals last week, and the proceeds will go into funding the drive. More brands are coming forward. I tweeted about it last week and there were 16 mails within 30 minutes.”,On what makes him go on, he says, “My faith in my Guru, Guru Nanak Dev, and my promise to my mother that I will see it through. She didn’t raise a quitter.” She did not.","Aug 30, 2020

"Prof Dungar Ram,Teachers’ Day is celebrated every year on September 5 — the birthday of Dr S Radhakrishnan, one of the most illustrious teachers of our times. No doubt the halo of glory around the day has faded a little and the annual celebration has been reduced to a mere ritual, still the commemoration is a befitting and well-deserved tribute to the towering figure.,The teacher has undoubtedly been accorded an exalted status in the Indian tradition. The importance of the role of the teacher in shaping the character, personality and career of students and thus in guiding the destiny of the nation can never be exaggerated. The teacher has been variously designated as a nation-builder, pathfinder, friend, philosopher and guide. All the actions of the teacher, including the reproach and reprimand, are considered to have only one motive behind — the welfare and betterment of students.,But Teachers’ Day is not merely a day to extend greetings and felicitations to teachers or confer awards and honours; it is a day of soul-searching, of critical analysis of the platform where the teacher stands today. Does he really deserve the glorious appreciation and commendable honours which he seeks? How much of the dignity which the teachers of the old wielded has he maintained? Does he perform his teaching duty with a sense of service, or he only craves for material gain? Is he aware that he is a role model to be followed and that morality and integrity are his watchwords?,The current scenario with regard to the position and reputation of the teacher in society, right from the elementary teacher to the university don, presents a dismal picture. The media frequently exposes and displays the ugly, immoral, shameful and even heinous activities of one teacher here and the other there. No wonder that epithets like ‘vultures’ and ‘hawks’ have come to be associated with such teachers. They may be only a handful in number, but they prove a blot on the whole class and tarnish its otherwise bright image. Let aside academic deterioration, the disdainful decline in morals is all the more condemnable. The trends are indeed challenging and command the attention not only of the administrative authorities, but also of all enlightened citizens.,We heap abundant praise on the teachers of the past most probably because we have no patience with their current-day counterparts. It has become almost a convention to shower admiration on the old pedagogues, but have a low esteem of the present-day generation of teachers. Now, it is very difficult to say with conviction that there were no black sheep in the teaching flock of the past. It may be argued that their dishonourable activities passed off without much uproar as press and electronic media were not so active. Take, for example, the case of corporal punishment. It was commonly believed that the teacher’s beating was well-intentioned. But today’s teacher must realise that not only the circumstances, but the laws have also undergone transformation. He must spare no effort to befit himself in the changing environment and equip himself with the new techniques to play his role positively.,Another point deserves careful examination. In the two-tier system of education — government schools and convent/public schools — a wide gulf has occurred. College teachers with government school background confronting students passing out from convent schools face several problems, including those of pronunciation and expression. The situation becomes awkward when the teacher turns out to be incompetent and his students have wider academic knowledge than him. There are examples where some brilliant students could not score the expected marks in examination perhaps because their answers happened to be beyond the comprehension and range of the examiner. The remedy lies in holding occasional in-service training camps, orientation, refresher courses and other similar academic exercises for the teachers.,It would surely be incorrect to claim that the ancient gurus or past teachers had superior academic standards. According to Shaw’s theory of Life Force, every new generation is wiser, more active, more intelligent than the previous one. How can, therefore, the teacher of the new generation alone be inferior? The moot point is the environment; perhaps the society itself is partly responsible for the teacher’s moral fall. The teacher is himself a product of society and we know mangoes can never grow on cacti.,The dark clouds surrounding the figure of the teacher should not dishearten and disappoint us. Innumerable conscientious and well-meaning teachers still exist who are committed to the cause of education. They still carry forward the torch of knowledge and learning and will never let it peter out. Only the younger ones among them will have to be more conscious and curious. They must bear in mind that teaching is still a noble profession and they must dedicate themselves to this great cause. They indeed have a heavy responsibility on their shoulders; the nation looks upon them with diehard optimism.,Wordsworth once said, “Every great poet is a teacher, I would like to be considered either as a teacher or as nothing.”,One reason probably for the negligence of the teacher is that teaching has never been regarded as a lucrative job. Once an elder in a village asked a teacher with several years of standing, “Have you got some job or are you still twisting children’s ears?” Needless to say that the elderly gentleman was too ignorant to appreciate the noble work handled by the teacher. The teaching environment at present has actually grown ignominiously vicious, but this day will prompt and motivate the teachers to rejuvenate themselves.,A teacher can still stir the soul of the nation, put a new lease of life into the diseased bones of the profession.,Awake, arise and act with courage in heart and faith in God, strive conscientiously, vigorously and honestly so as to regain the crowning glory that you once had and that you richly deserve!","Sep 01, 2020

"PESTICIDES are toxic chemicals applied to crops for killing insect pests, plant pathogens and weeds. Less than one per cent of the more than one million identified species of insects are ‘pests’. Rather, a large number of insect species provide essential ecosystem services as plant pollinators, nutrient recyclers, trash burners, natural enemies of pests, and act as food for birds, fishes, amphibians, reptiles and small mammals, as components of food chains and food webs. Without these services, agriculture, forests and even human civilisation as a whole will not survive for long. Therefore, the pesticides need to be applied with utmost caution to minimise their adverse impact on humans, non-target organisms and the environment.,Rachel Carson, in her monumental book , effectively focused the attention of the public, scientists and policy-makers on the consequences of the indiscriminate use of pesticides and prompted governments around the world to start regulating the use of pesticides.,In India, the Insecticides Act, 1968, regulates the manufacture, import, sale, and use of pesticides. Under the Act, the Government of India has over the years banned the production and use of 40 pesticides. The Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare constituted an expert committee headed by Anupam Varma in 2013 to review the use of 66 pesticides, which were already banned or restricted in other countries. Based on the committee’s recommendations, followed by the regulators’ decision and its own decision on the subject, the ministry issued a draft order on May 14, 2020, banning 27 pesticides in the country. Stakeholders were given 45 days (later extended by another 45 days) to file their response to the draft order.,In view of the order, state agricultural universities (SAUs) are making efforts to replace the banned items with alternative pesticides in their recommendations for the farmers. This is not a desirable approach to integrated pest management (IPM). In Europe, when many chemical pesticides were banned by the European Food Safety Authority, most of these were replaced by the release of natural enemies for biological control of pests. In India also, there is a need to replace the banned chemical pesticides with non-chemical tactics, especially pest-resistant genotypes, cultural control practices and biological control, and shift crop protection steadily towards bio-intensive approaches. Ecosystem biodiversity in the form of inter-crops, trap crops, and plants in adjoining fields/non-cropped areas would help to keep populations of most pests at the sub-economic level. About 350 species of natural enemies (predators, entomopathogens) are commercially produced and utilised in crop management around the world. In India, only about a dozen such species are being mass-multiplied.,There is unlikely to be an adverse impact of the banning of 27 pesticides on agricultural production because safer alternatives are available in the market. But agricultural universities need to be more stringent while recommending new pesticides for crop protection. Data on the impact of new chemicals on all non-target organisms, especially pollinators, natural enemies, secondary pests and microbiota, must be generated for informed decisions on new recommendations.,In Punjab, the only significant challenge to replacing the banned pesticides appears to be herbicide pendimethalin, which is widely used as a pre-emergence treatment in direct-seeded rice and other crops. The cultural method of stale seed bed is useful and needs to be popularised among farmers as a component of integrated weed management (IWM). It helps to significantly lower the weed density in the field.,The banning of the 27 pesticides presents a golden opportunity to agricultural universities, state departments of agriculture and the farming community to take the big leap required towards bio-intensive IPM for environmentally safe crop protection. This can be a win-win situation for farmers and consumers, besides the environment.","Aug 31, 2020

"Reigning World Rapid champion Koneru Humpy was finally forced out of her social media hibernation to accept the new world. She prefers to concentrate on her game or her young family, but to celebrate the Indian team’s ‘historic’ gold at the FIDE Online Olympiad, the queen of the chessboard broke her social media exile.,The customary ‘thank you’ replies to influential stars and politicians were followed by a message to her fans about the existence of a fake account. “Following account is not mine: twitter.com/HumpyKoneru. I request Twitter India to take appropriate action,” Humpy, world’s No. 2 ranked woman player, wrote on her verified Twitter page.,This was unlike anything the 32-year-old star with a FIDE rating of 2586 had done, but with the surge in interest in chess, she realised she had to get real online. “I was never interested in social media. I always knew there was a fake account but I never really bothered. But after this victory, many wanted me to respond to fans so I thought OK, I should better clarify now,” said Humpy, who played a stellar role in the Indian team’s passage to the final by clinching the tie-breaker against Poland.,If the discussion on her new dalliance with social media brought a big chuckle over the phone, Humpy broke out into laughter when describing how fans, mediapersons and everyone got involved to solve the power outage issue that caused defeat from a seemingly winning position for both her and captain Vidit Gujrathi against Mongolia. The duo lost on time after the power breakdown.,The minor setback got both Gujrathi and his deputy Srinath Narayanan to use their connections to ensure that the team suffered no such misfortune in the knockouts. As a result, an engineer and a line worker were positioned near Humpy’s house in Hyderabad for every game and Viswanathan Anand’s apartment complex in Chennai saw no power outage.,— Viswanathan Anand,“This, perhaps, was the first instance where everyone joined hands... Many from the media used their contacts with the local internet guys (to ensure connectivity) and even the fans helped out,” Humpy explained.,“We never got such attention before. But this Olympiad is historic as everyone will remember this for a very long time,” she added.,Historic moment,It was indeed historic — the tournament began in 1927, and India debuted in it at Moscow in 1956 and promptly finished at the bottom of the pile. But an Indian had figured in the tournament previously — Sultan Khan, of Sargodha in the undivided Punjab, played at three Olympiads for England.,India won a medal for the first time in 2014, when the team of Parimarjan Negi, P Sethuraman, K Sasikiran, B Adhiban and Lalith Babu finished third behind China and Hungary.,India’s greatest player, Viswanathan Anand, had not prioritised this event; he played in the biennial tournament five times in a row from 1984 to 1992, and then in 2004 and 2006, before making a return in 2018. His best is a individual silver in 2004, the year he took India to their then best of sixth position. But Anand was not India’s first medallist at the Olympiad — that honour goes to Rafiq Khan, a carpenter from Bhopal, who won a bronze on the 3rd Board — ie, among designated third-best players in all teams — in 1980.,Anand was wise to focus on his individual career as he was challenging for the world title, which he won several times; also, he probably did not have the motivation to compete in a tournament in which most of his teammates would be floundering.,However, as the GMs inspired by him became stronger, India’s standing in the world of chess improved. India were ranked No. 7 for the Online Olympiad — a sign of the depth of talent in the country. And this time, India had an ace up their sleeves — the top-class teenagers.,Format, juniors clicked,For the first time, junior boards were included this year — each team had to have one male and female player aged 20 or below. This proved advantageous for India as several talented youngsters such as Nihal Sarin (age 16, with ELO rating of 2620), R Praggnanandhaa (16, ELO 2608) and Raunak Sadhwani (14, ELO 2545) have emerged in the past few years. India has added an impressive 21 GMs in the last three years — and eight of them were in the 10-19 age-group when they got their final GM norm.,When called into action at the Online Olympiad, the teens held their own. Nihal beat Igor Janik in the semifinals against Poland when many of the accomplished names in the team, including Anand and Gujrathi, lost.,The other thing that clicked was the team spirit. “It was easy. Both Anand and Humpy are legends and made my life very easy, practically left all the decisions to me,” captain Gujrathi explained.,Tough act to follow,Observers are quick to point out that while getting on the podium as joint winners with Russia (seven-time winners, plus 18 times as part of USSR) is big, a full-fledged Olympiad, where the top-five ranked players of a country participate, would be another ball game altogether.,International Master V Saravanan is delighted but also cautious. “US did not make it to the final because Hikaru Nakamura and Fabiano Caruana were not in the team. When teams like Russia, USA and China compete with their full bench strength, then India is out of contention,” Saravanan said. “But there is no denying that it is a significant achievement as they finished joint first amongst 163 countries.”,Online boom,The Covid pandemic has given a big fillip to India’s booming chess fraternity. More than 69,000 Indians were logged online to watch the final. Websites like ChessBase India and lichess.org and talk shows by Suryashekhar Ganguly had fans riveted to their screens.,“There is a feel-good factor. There is a lot of online activity because of the pandemic. You have more than 150 GMs playing Title Tuesday, which is featured on chess.com. It is here Arjun Kalyan beat Alireza Firouzja, who is touted as Magnus Carlsen’s next biggest contender,” Saravanan said.,Gujrathi is hopeful of a golden future. “We cannot sit on this thinking we have talented young players,” he said. “We have to have a proper system so that the talent doesn’t go to waste. Olympians train for four years to have one shot at glory. We need a similar professional approach.”,At present, it is all down to individual effort. And the fact that Anand, in his 51st year, is still easily India’s best, despite obvious decline, speaks volumes. Since he became India No. 1 in 1986, only Pentala Harikrishna was able to overtake Anand, albeit for only one day in 2016! The juniors need to work hard to catch him before trying to catch the world.,“People like Vidit, Praggnanandhaa and Nihal are on par with Anand’s talent when he broke out. But talent almost doesn’t matter after reaching the 2700 rating mark. A person’s approach, how happy and settled he is in life… Things like these will decide careers,” Saravanan said.,India have four GMs in the world top-100 — the number is 24 for Russia, 10 for USA and nine for China. Ex-USSR countries such as Armenia and Azerbaijan have five each. It’s clear that while possessing 66 GMs is impressive, to become a real chess power, India must get more of them in the top-100.

"Jupinderjit Singh,More than nine decades back, a man from Mitha Tiwana village of Punjab (now in Pakistan) travelled to England by sea. Two days upon his arrival, he beat the reigning world champion Jose Capablanca in a simultaneous chess exhibition match.,That win was no fluke as Capablanca was playing against 40 players, known as a simultaneous chess match. This man was Sultan Khan, who had only recently learnt the international format of chess after his first appearance in the Indian national championship.,Khan stayed in London for about four years. He beat the world champion again in a one-to-one match and won the British Chess Championship thrice. He also beat Czech Grandmaster Solomom Flohr and had a draw with Grandmaster Alekhine.,Despite beating the English, Sultan Khan passed into obscurity with neither the Indian nor the Pakistan government remembering his feat. FIDE, the world chess governing body, also did not commemorate his mastery. He died of tuberculosis in 1966 in his village, with not even an obituary for him in mainstream media.,He was part of the chess folklore in Punjab, though, as some old-timers often narrated his remarkable feat to youngsters.,According to chessmetrics.com, which calculates historical chess ratings, Khan was for at least a couple of years among the world’s top 10 players, and ranked No. 6 in the world at his best. Sultan’s feat is being remembered with the discovery of some rare games he had played, including the one against Capablanca in the simultaneous chess match, much before his game against the same player in 1930 in the British Chess Championship, which saw him in the headlines. A well-known chess player and commentator, Daniel King, has discovered these games and reproduced with modern analysis in his book, Sultan Khan — The Indian servant who became chess champion of the British Empire.,RN Coles’ book on him, Mir Sultan Khan-Biography and games from the first Grandmaster of chess from India, was published in 1965 but it did not have details about his personal life. In his book, King mentions that one Sir Umar Hayat Khan, a Muslim landlord and politician, saw his servant’s brilliance in chess and sponsored him. He claimed Umar Hayat “used his servant’s successes to promote his political interests in the turbulent years before India gained Independence.”,In an online petition, Indian players through chessbaseindia.com are seeking the Grandmaster title for him. Meanwhile, players in Kolkata have kept his memory alive by naming a indoor sports hall as Sultan Khan Memorial Hall in the Salt Lake Football stadium.,From The Tribune archives,King’s book says Khan passed into obscurity after he arrived in India. However, The Tribune newspaper archives reveal that Khan was active till 1940. News reports said he played simultaneous matches with 40 players just after he landed in Mumbai after making it big in the UK. Another report said he played simul tournaments against 20 players, and won all games. That tournament was held at Dera Ismail Khan in February 1940. Khan won the Governor’s Trophy for his feat.","Sep 06, 2020

"Tribune News Service,Amritsar, September 1,The Golden Temple Mail, earlier known as the Frontier Mail, completed 92 years of its run as it chugged out of the Amritsar railway station on Tuesday.,The then British Indian government had projected it as its glorious achievement for being the longest train link in the Indian subcontinent as it had its inaugural run on this day in 1928.,The Frontier Mail’s punctuality too was something to reckon with. It was generally believed that your Rolex watch might let you down, but not the Frontier Mail. The punctuality of the Frontier Mail was of such crucial importance to the fastidious British bosses that when on one occasion, in August 1929, exactly 11 months after its inauguration, the train arrived 15 minutes late, there was a big uproar among railway circles, with the driver being asked to explain the reasons for this ‘inexcusable’ delay.,Earlier, the Bombay Baroda and Central India Railway Company in conjunction with the North Western Railway Company had introduced the Frontier Mail from Bombay to Peshawar via Delhi and Lahore on October 7, 1927.,The Frontier Mail was formally renamed as the Golden Temple Mail in September 1996. The Frontier Mail is a mere shadow of its former glory today. Nonetheless, the train has an appeal and charisma that will live on in the hearts of its faithful passengers for a long time to come.,SP Singh Bhatia, Heritage Officer of the Ferozepur Division, said initially the train was routed via Bathinda, Ferozepur and Lahore to Peshawar, now in Pakistan. But from March 1, 1930, it was routed through Saharanpur, Ambala and Amritsar. Since then this train has been running on the same route. After the Partition, the destination of this train was cut short and now the train terminates at Amritsar.,“That was the time when the Frontier Mail could lay claim to being India’s fastest long-distance train, a fact that was highlighted in The Times in London in 1930, when it described the Frontier Mail as ‘one of the most famous express trains under the British Empire’.”,The Frontier Mail’s punctuality too was something to reckon with. It was generally believed that your Rolex watch might let you down, but not the Frontier Mail. The punctuality of the Frontier Mail was of such crucial importance to the fastidious British bosses that when on one occasion, in August 1929, exactly 11 months after its inauguration, the train arrived 15 minutes late, there was a big uproar among railway circles, with the driver being asked to explain the reasons for this ‘inexcusable’ delay. A blemish indeed on the jewel in the BB & CIR crown. In fact, people used to set their watches with the arrival of this train at the station, said Bhatia.,The train’s dining car was cooled by ceiling fans, white damask on the tables coupled with white napkins brought fineness in dining. Silver cutlery and exquisite crockery with crystal fruit platters were placed on each table, along with salt and pepper shakers. The table settings had to be perfect, with different forks and knives for each course.,The Frontier Mail was one of the first trains in India to get an air-conditioned car running from 1934. However, he added, the air-conditioning system was basic, nothing like the thermostat-controlled power plants we see today.,Elaborating on the air-conditioning system in those days, Bhatia said it used ice blocks, carried in sealed receptacles built beneath the car floor. These were replenished at several halts along the line. A battery-operated blower constantly blew air into these receptacles, and the cold air entered the insulated cars through vents.,Divisional Railway Manager, Ferozepur Division, Rajesh Aggarwal said efforts were being made to maintain the high standards of boarding and lodging in the train with the pantry cars serving an array of delicious dishes from the hygienic environment.","Sep 02, 2020

"Hyperlocal cuisine is exactly what the name implies — extremely local cuisine. And it is local to the extent that the produce is cultivated or grown on the premises of the restaurant offering the cuisine.,Eating local and hyperlocal food is one way to get the healthiest of dishes while making a small contribution to the environment. “There are 22 varieties of greens, including kale and lettuce, that Pullman & Novotel, Delhi, grows in its in-house farm of 5,000 sq ft,” says chef Neeraj Tyagi, culinary director. The upscale property offers ‘Rooted in Nature’ buffets over lunch and dinner that focus on micro greens, sustainable farming and endless varieties of greens.,Andaz, Delhi, too sources organic vegetables, asparagus, lemony curried dressing and 780 edible flowers from Tijara Farm, its artisan partner. “The use of edible flowers in dishes sparks creativity, making a dish visually appealing to the eye. Some of our dishes, like the Nutrition Bomb, also involve the use of microgreens which are grown in-house under controlled conditions,” says executive chef Vikram Ganpule.,As ‘buy fresh, buy local’ becomes a global slogan, chefs are scurrying to be in the race. Chef and entrepreneur Tarun Sibal says, “The interest in sustainable development, where food is produced with an equal importance to responsibility towards the environment as well as economic growth and viability, has created a demand for locally sourced and hyperlocal food. Parmesan in India can’t be hyperlocal, but a soft burrata coming from the dairy farm next-door is hyperlocal. Though a lot of things can be hyperlocal, it is primarily kitchen gardens, backyards, window sills, rooftop and terrace gardens that are now used for growing herbs and plants which do not need too much space or maintenance. In Goa we use lot of avocado, passion fruit and papaya in our dishes as they are grown there. In Delhi/NCR, we use lot of black carrot, saag and bathua in winters.”,The onus lies with the chefs and how much and how quickly they can innovate. Rachel Goenka, founder of The Chocolate Spoon Company, says chefs have a better understanding of where their produce is coming from can translate this message through their food to customers as well. “Hydroponic farming has also made it easier for restaurants to grow their own produce. There is also the social responsibility of supporting local farmers and organic farming.”,The rationale behind the concept of hyperlocal food is freshness and high nutrient value. Hyperlocal food eliminates the process of artificial storage of food as the gap from farm to plate gets minimised. Chef Abhijeet Khot, sous chef at The Den, Bengaluru, says, “Hyperlocal ingredients are grown depending on the climatic condition of the place and space available. They need lots of care and attention too.” However, it also means tweaking the menu as per the seasonal produce. And a green plate is worth the trouble.,Courtesy: Andaz, Delhi","Sep 06, 2020

"A lot has been said and ‘shared’ about memes — often sarcastic, at times irreverent, and almost always entertaining. But not much is known about the creative doodlers or memers, the persons who made you laugh umpteen times with their funny posts on social media. With jokes and memes going viral, the profession of making memes has found its verticals: full time, freelance to professionals and amateurs. Looking at the brains behind some of these posts which have brought smiles on our faces in the middle of the pandemic:,Shekhar Dahal (31) was in college pursuing a Master’s degree when he and his friends started following pages which published memes. “We particularly liked 9GAG. These were crisp and funny.” Soon Shekhar started creating his own content. It’s nearly three years since he started The Visual House page on Instagram.The best videos and memes on the page have touched nearly 300k likes.Thescriptwriter and assistant director says that he has merged his passion with profession. “You can earn between Rs20,000 and Rs2 lakh a month as a meme maker,” adds Shekhar.,Twentysix-year-old Jitendra Sharma’s interest in memes peaked around 2008 when there was an introduction of Rage Comics in India. “I was barely 14 then, and all I had was a newly registered Facebook account,” shares the man behind the meme page @tedthestoner, which boasts of 1.5 million followers. Many companies keep chasing him with their offers. “I have received job offers because of Ted. Some political parties also approached me to create content for them. But my vision for the page is very different from a company that runs purely on a profit basis.”,This is also the sentiment shared by 21-year-old psychology student Aakash Rawat, behind his video memes, which go by the name DesiQueerMemes. He started the venture a year back to make fun of serious situations. Little did he realise that in the process, he’d be contributing to smashing taboos associated with the gay community. “Today I have a loyal fan base. Many brands approach me to endorse their products but I make sure that the advertisers respect my terms and conditions”, he says, adding, “I wear their stuff in my videos, and that’s it”. With a decent following, one can easily make Rs40,000 to Rs50,000 a month, he says.,A little bit of curiosity about the brains behind that funny post, at times even leads to amused ‘fans’ reaching out. Shares Karan Jalan, who often has audience reaching out to him through his content page with fan mails and kind words. “I came up with a series wherein the idea was to make fun of ourselves. In a way that resonated with everyone without belittling anyone.”,Jitendra would have you believe that “making memes is no rocket science. These are just funny pictures with text on them”. He says, “If you think you have a funny bone, you must try your hand at creating memes.” For passionate amateurs, there are many meme-making apps on the web. For those serious about pursuing it as a profession, ‘meme careers’ is a bona fide category in the job search engines. All the meme makers agree on one thing though, there are no rules or any rule book when it comes to getting paid for making memes. “Do not start with the expectation that you’ll be making lot of money. It’ll come later, though,” advises Jitender, adding that, “the best payments I got were messages telling me that my memes had helped bring smiles in difficult phases of their lives.” If not payments, that takes care of the perks checkbox.","Sep 20, 2020

"For over a century now, the ancestral home of Indian Socialist Revolutionary — Shaheed Bhagat Singh — is the pride of Khatkar Kalan in Nawanshahr.,But a few people know that the house was built in 1858 by Bhagat Singh’s great-grandfather Fateh Singh, who named it ‘Deewan Khana’, as he would hold a durbar at the house to impart justice to the people of his village. Besides, he used to encourage people and tell them that governments may come and go, but their problems would find solutions if they earmark them jointly.,As the country will be celebrating Bhagat Singh’s 113th birth anniversary on September 28, let’s all pledge to bring the change he dreamt of, and, instead of holding rallies, political events, we should follow his ideology in true spirit. Taking the message from this house, people should strengthen gram sabhas to plan the village. Bhagat Singh raised the slogans of Inquilab Zindabad and Samrajyavad Murdabad, but the country’s leaders and some parties were limiting his message, thereby restricting his ideology. ,It is said that after the death of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the East India Company officials started suppressing people. So, to protect themselves, people took up arms. During the 1857 revolt, the British government requested Fateh Singh for help against the rebels, but he refused to oblige.,“Since then, the house has been an epitome of great values and resistance to the colonial rule exhibited by the family,” said Prof Jagmohan Singh, Ludhiana-based nephew of Bhagat Singh.,Throwing light on his struggle to protect the house, Prof Jagmohan said: “While the portraits of Bhagat Singh have made their way to the offices of politicians, especially those from Punjab, who make a beeline to Khatkar Kalan village on every birth and death anniversary of Bhagat Singh or during elections, the martyr gets effaced from their memories in a matter of days.”,As per information, Bhagat Singh’s mother lived in this house till 1975, but it was in 1982, that the house was declared a monument under the Punjab Ancient and Historical Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1964. After that the family handed over its responsibility to the government to preserve it as a national monument. But the legendary freedom fighter’s house was relatively ignored for a long time. Sources say it was first in 2005, when the chappar (sewer pond) found in front of Bhagat Singh’s house was converted into a memorial park, but the structure of the house was not touched and one of its walls remained in bad shape and the paint peeled off from its lower walls owing to dampness. Prof Jagmohan Singh said: “The Department of Archives/ Culture used to be mostly out of funds whenever they were approached for restoration. It was like we had to beg in front of the government for grants even though the house’s upkeep should have been its job.” It was only in 2015 that the Department of Cultural Affairs, Archaeology and Museums, for the first time, started restoring the house since it was handed over to it in 1984 by the family. Before that, the local panchayat used to take care of the house. The house was restored at a cost of Rs42 lakh by the state government, he said.,Prof Jagmohan recalled that in 2017, when then Punjab Tourism Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu went to the village to take stock of the ongoing museum work at the village, he handed over a cheque for Rs2.5 lakh from his ministerial funds to then Deputy Commissioner Sonali Giri, in favour of Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL), as the state government miserably failed to clear the power bills of freedom fighter Bhagat Singh’s house and of the memorial park. “Such was the plight of the house and ignorance of the state government,” he said.,Items such as utensils, wooden boxes, a table, an almirah, some pictures, an old wooden bed with carving, a weighing machine, a charkha (spinning wheel), and a typewriter, which is said to be of historical importance and has links with the freedom fighter, have been put on display at the house.,It was in July 2015 that the state government hired a Chandigarh-based private firm to carry out the restoration work at the house in a way that it could attract more and more visitors.,The restoration work was completed in 2016 and the roofs, which were in a dilapidated condition earlier, were removed and replaced with new ones keeping the original form. The walls of the rooms, kitchen have now been repaired with a special technique to strengthen these by restoring its historical value. The floors of the building were restored and its level has also been raised. Old doors and windows have been replaced with new ones. Special cabins for displaying the belongings of the martyr and his family have been made, so that these are not damaged by visitors by frequently touching it. The house has got a complete facelift and is one of the most visited places in Punjab.","Sep 09, 2020

"AGRICULTURE experts and farmers in Punjab have given a thumbs up to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent statement underlining the need for imparting lessons in farming to schoolchildren. The PM was referring to the reforms under the National Education Policy (NEP-2020) for introducing agriculture as a subject at the middle school level.,Vice Chancellor of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, Prof Baldev Singh Dhillon, says, “Integrating agriculture with school education is very important. Agriculture is directly associated with the lives of more than 70 per cent of our country’s population. Schoolchildren need to be educated about agriculture and associated fields like agri-entrepreneurship and agro-processing, which are new areas of study.”,Dhillon says education in agriculture at the school level is important for connecting with the Indian Agricultural Research Institutes (IARIs) that are coming up across the country. Simply put, there has to be greater sensitisation towards educating farmers to look for diversifying crops instead of the routine summer and winter crop plantation.,Pavail Gill, an organic farmer based in Fatehgarh Sahib district, says, “Besides producing better-educated farmers, connecting agriculture with education will allow more thinking minds to argue in favour of a better deal for farmers.”,Gill says, “A curriculum containing agriculture and ‘science of growing food’ can help children in their personal and professional lives. Times are very challenging today. Climate change has affected the global food cycle of the world. Schools need to kindle interest among students to educate themselves in a subject that dealt with the survival of the human race.”,A senior professor at the Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development (CRRID), Dr Sucha Singh Gill, feels bringing modern technology to agriculture is not the task of schools but that of agriculture extension services provided by state agriculture departments and agriculture universities in the country. He says the ground reality of school education in the country is worrying. “Rural schools lack adequate staff and have poor infrastructure. They need adequate funding and improvement in quality of education, an issue not touched upon by the PM,” he adds.,Bharti Kisan Union (BKU) president Balbir Singh Rajewal says receiving education about agriculture is very important for children. “We had special chapters in our school books about farm activities. I don’t know when these vanished from the books. This means our education policy-makers sadly chose not to let children get educated about agriculture,” he rues.,“Leave aside deep understanding, mere information about farming, harvesting, packaging and selling is vital for society. This had the inbuilt scope of educating people about the potential of agro-entrepreneurship in the country,” says Rajewal.,Ajay Chaudhary, sarpanch of Taloor village in Gurdaspur district, says, “Starting to work on our own land when I was very young, I learnt that the farming exercise sub-consciously equipped me with leadership and communication skills. I was able to learn the importance of working with the community.”,A public school-educated Chaudhary says while most of his classmates went in for jobs after graduation, he opted to stay back in his village for farming. “Having spent nearly 28 years on growing crops or maintaining a dairy, I feel this is a very satisfying career. I am sure several more could have done the same if they were better educated.”,“Teaching children agriculture in classes is not a bad idea. The government only needs to ensure that the teaching involves practical lessons in the fields rather than rote learning,” he adds.","Sep 07, 2020

"ASHOK Kundu (30), son of a farmer who earned a living by cultivating three acres at Khairi village in Uklana block, has migrated to Hisar with his family. He is keen to start his own business venture rather than following in his father’s footsteps. Kundu says, “Agriculture is no more a profitable occupation. It’s difficult for a farmer to give priority to the education of his children.” Kundu has leased out the family’s land to another farmer in the village.,Amid such a dismal scenario in the agriculture sector, the idea to introduce farm education at the middle level in schools has come as a whiff of fresh air for the peasantry. Farmers and agriculture say this is one of the many steps needed to be taken to keep farming in the family and catch the attention of new-age entrepreneurs and businessmen to the field of agri-business.,Agriculture scientists say getting a job is a priority for the youngsters. Though the latter try to explore options in agri-business and other entrepreneurship arenas, lack of awareness and expertise is a stumbling block for them, claim experts, adding that introduction to farm education at an early stage can turn the tide.,As per a report of the Indian Chamber of Food and Agriculture (ICFA), the share of the agriculture sector in Haryana’s economy has been declining over the years. The share of agriculture and allied sectors in the GSDP has fallen from 60.7% in 1969-70 to 21.3% in 2006-07 and 15.3% in 2013-14.,Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pitched for introducing agriculture-related education at the middle school level. The PM has stated that knowledge of agriculture and its practical application at the school level will help in developing agriculture-related understanding in students and enable them to disseminate information about modern farming techniques and marketing to their family members.,Sajjan Kumar, a young villager from Bhiwani district, says it’s a good decision to introduce agriculture as a subject at the school level. “As of now, students are acquainted with basic facts about agriculture during schooling. Agriculture needs to be introduced as a separate subject for comprehensive understanding of the field which is the mainstay of the economy of many states and the country as a whole,” he observes.,Kumar says the farming sector should be made attractive for the younger lot. “Besides basic agriculture, there are related fields such as agro-entrepreneurship, marketing and processing which have the potential to employ huge human resources,” he adds.,Dr Kuldeep Dhindsa, an eminent agriculture scientist, says Haryana is a leading contributor of foodgrains and milk. “Agriculture is the principal occupation of the people in the state. But falling returns have led to lack of interest in the next generation of farmers in rural Haryana. Now, they prefer to be employed for a meagre Rs 10,000 per month in the private sector where they have to work for 8-10 hours a day,” he says, adding that the overall situation can be improved if along with introducing agriculture in schools, the government also take a serious view of the Swaminathan Commission recommendations.,Dr Dhindsa says Hisar-based Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agricultural University (HAU) introduced BSc Agriculture course as an integrated five-year programme after Class X to draw matriculates. “The PM’s initiative will bear fruit if the colleges and universities, too, start courses after matriculation,” he adds.,Dr Ram Kumar, an agriculturist, says exposure to agriculture as a subject in schools is not enough to attract the new generation to agriculture-related occupations. “A meagre number of agricultural university passouts or retired professors get engaged in farming,” he says. Dr Kumar says agriculture and allied sectors need to be viable to attract the youth.","Sep 07, 2020

"Sarika Sharma,In a letter from jail in 1975, Pash cautioned Surjit Patar against sycophants. “Don’t be too enamoured by their praise,” he warned. “Popularity is a noose around your neck. Don’t let it sway you.”,Pash had a love-hate relationship with his contemporaries. In a beautiful poem, he told Amrita Pritam to move beyond ‘Ajj Akkhan Waris Shah Nu’ and asked her to respond to the age of revolt. From Shiv Kumar to Amrita Pritam, from Harbhajan Singh to Patar, he engaged with all. When Harbhajan Singh said Pash’s poetry did not hold value more than that of a red rag, he responded with a poem titled ‘Inkaar’. He refused to change his metaphors to please someone else. Drawing a line between their poetry, he said he would not write about flowers, women, fine music. He would rather write about the village cobbler’s blindness, the ironsmith’s blistered skin, or the woman whose hands have cracked with washing utensils. When Pakistani poet Ahmed Salim was sentenced to jail for his writings, Pash wrote him a poem, ‘Ahmed Salim De Naam’, saying Salim’s poetry had finally bore fruit.,Fame never eluded Pash even when he was alive, but acceptance from fellow poets certainly did. In his death, however, the paradigm shift he brought to Punjabi poetry was well accepted and documented in the poems and essays his contemporaries wrote remembering him.,More than 150 poems were penned on Pash by 95 poets and authors after his death; his father, Maj Sohan Singh Sandhu, had compiled these as his last project before his death in 2013. The writers came from a colourful spectrum and included famous names such as Patar, Amarjit Chandan, Santokh Singh Dhir and Harbhajan Singh, underground leader Harbhajan Sohi and Pakistani poet Mazhar Tirmazi. Critic Raghbir Singh admitted to the bias Pash faced and acknowledged that his contemporaries had righted him in his death. “With time, his work became a toast of poetic circles,” he wrote in the preface to a book on Pash.,Over the years, Pash’s symbolism, that arose from everyday life, his unpoetic idioms have become a cult. Perhaps the first Punjabi poet to have been killed for his writings, he is a favourite with Left-leaning scholars and is recited at protests.,His friend of 20 years, London-based Chandan, says he still cannot believe it is Pash’s 70th birthday. “His young handsome face is etched in my memory.” A student of Chandan’s uncle, Pash had coloured his hair blonde when they first met. He still remembers his eyes, his beautiful naturally kohled eyes that Pash himself mentioned in several of his poems. As the image, his poetry too doesn’t fade.,“His untimely death at the hands of the enemies of Punjab made this image and every word written by him permanent. It is rather ironic that both Sikh and Hindu fundamentalists are united in hating the truthful poems he wrote close to his death. He will always be remembered for these poems,” Chandan says. When he went to meet Pash in California (where he had moved following Khalistani threats in 1986) in January 1988, the latter was in India. Chandan had then penned a poem (see box) imagining him there and wondered how Pash would react. Alas, Pash was assassinated during that trip. Chandan’s last meeting with Pash remained unrealised, his poem never reached him.,The shadow of death had been on Pash’s mind for long. He had confided in poet Ajmer Rode. “Those were the days when Punjab was gripped by terrorism and death haunted Pash. He said it wasn’t really death that scared him, but the constant uncertainty, the ever-present shadow of death that followed him. ‘It is deadly and doesn’t let you do anything creative,’ he had told me,” says Rode, who recently wrote a book, ‘Pash Da Sath’. As a spontaneous response to Pash’s death, he had written ‘A Movie Scene’.,Whether they were of opposing ideologies or his friends, frankness marked Pash’s relationship with his contemporaries. In his letter to Patar, he had said: “Good ideology can give birth to bad poetry; bad ideology can birth good poetry.”,McFarland California,— By Amarjit Chandan,Pash lives here in the orchards,plums, apples, grapes,oranges, apricots,in the fields of wheat and cotton,Wind, sun, pigeons,drowsy tractors,ask Pash:,tell us: what was it like as a child,,and as a young man?,When cotton balls bloom like,clusters of stars in your dreams,don’t you feel restless?,When you remember the sun,sliding on sand dunes in your village,,on the prison walls, in the dreams of the,sleeping prisoners, don’t you feel sad?,Pash stays quiet.,On a nearby line,children’s clothes sway,in the afternoon sun.,—Translated by John Welch and Ajmer Rode","Sep 06, 2020

"One of the first things that every consumer should be aware of is the highly inflammable nature of alcohol-based sanitisers. The alcohol in the hand rub evaporates readily at room temperature and it is these vapours that mix with air and ignite in the presence of a fire source. In fact, one should know that the vapour can spread or travel and if this vapour trail comes in contact with an ignition source, it not only catches fire, but the fire produced can flash back or travel back to the liquid.,That’s how a 44-year-old resident of Rewari, Haryana, suffered 35 per cent burn injuries while cleaning his cell phone and keys with an alcohol-based sanitiser in the kitchen in March this year. According to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Delhi, where he was admitted for treatment, he spilled some of the liquid on to his clothes during the process and the fumes from the alcohol reached the fire — his wife was cooking on a gas stove nearby — and before he could even realise what was happening, his clothes were on fire. So remember not to use the hand rub near any source of fire.,I must also mention the possible danger of a spark from static electricity igniting the alcohol fumes. Some people are more prone to such static shocks than others. In April this year, an employee of Gassco, Norway, sanitised his hands with an alcohol-based hand rub and touched a metal surface when the hands were still wet. Due to static electricity, the vapour from the hand sanitiser ignited with an almost invisible flame on both his hands. The employee rushed to a sink and immediately extinguished the flames, but suffered first and second degree burns on both the hands.,Such cases are rare, but can happen. In fact, a severe burn injury caused to an 11-year-old girl in a children’s hospital in Oregon, USA, in 2013, was traced to fumes from the sanitiser spill on the girl’s dress igniting on account of static electricity. Olive oil was used on her head to remove the glue used for an EEG test earlier and had dripped on to her dress. That fed the flames further, the report on the cause of the fire said. There are similar reports of burn injuries caused by static electricity and sanitisers in two hospitals in the United States — in 2006 and 2002.,So whenever you use a sanitiser, allow it to dry completely and the vapours to disperse before you touch any surface. Never touch anything with hands still wet from a sanitiser. I would suggest similar precautions while lighting a matchstick or operating an electric switch or any electric gadget that could give out a spark.,Yes, you need to ensure that these sanitisers are kept out of reach of children. If at all they need to use them, it has to be only under adult supervision. These days because of the Covid pandemic, wherever you go, you find large hand rub bottles in spray dispensers. There is every possibility of a child accessing them and trying to use them. So, watch out!,I must also mention that a friend recently told me about a persistent eye problem that was eventually traced to continued exposure to the sanitiser spray. In fact, in ‘Sanitiser aerosol driven ocular surface disease — a Covid-19 repercussion’, a paper published in the Indian Journal of Ophthalmology, doctors from the Narayana Nethralaya Eye Institute, Bengaluru, refer to a number of cases of eye irritation, redness and dryness that they came across and traced to increasing and constant use of sanitisers. The doctors advised consumers to close their eyes while pressing the dispenser and also keep it below eye level during usage. And use the sanitiser prudently, they said.,The bottom line is: use soap and water to disinfect your hands and use sanitisers only when the first option is not available.","Sep 06, 2020

"Thirty-two years hence, my father lives on and inspires people’s hearts, ignites discussions, makes it to university syllabuses and is often the theme of research scholars’ PhDs. Even today, his poetry changes lives of the youth and inspires young men and women to follow in his footsteps. It goes without saying, I am proud to be the daughter of this revolutionary, powerful, influential, progressive and daring poet.,I was born in a small village of Talwandi Salem (Jalandhar) in January 1981. Those were times when people would shed tears at a daughter’s birth. But here was my father — celebrating my coming into this world, distributing sweets to everyone in our village and playing loud music on the speaker! Many were perplexed at his happiness, but only he understood the beauty, sincerity and value of a daughter’s birth and what she brings to a family.,I was seven when tragedy struck. A first-grader, I didn’t realise what a loss it was for Punjab. I just knew I would never be able to run into my father’s arms again, or hear his voice, share milestones together, or be able to be loved by him. Slowly, the memories faded.,As I grew up, my family helped me understand him, who he was, as a father, more so as a writer. My aunts Pammy and Rajinder, uncles Ajit and Sucha, my mom, my grandmother and some of my father’s closest friends — Surinder Dhanjal, Chaman Lal, Sukwinder Kamboj and Amarjit Chandan, to name a few — told me what he was like and I today feel that even though he isn’t here, I know him. I am forever indebted to my grandfather, Maj Sohan Singh Sandhu, who was my best resource person on my father. After Papa’s death, he was the father figure in my life.,In the past three decades, people have come to me from all over the world to express how much love and admiration they have for my father. To say the least, it makes me feel immensely proud, speechless with gratitude and taken aback by all their words. Every time I go back to Talwandi Salem, it brings me great pleasure to live in our home, to see and feel the ‘khet’, the fields he loved so much, and to live the simple ‘pind’ life he wrote about. I can’t wait to share these moments with his grandchildren.,Every poetry festival I have ever attended across the world has a dedicated segment to recognise Pash, and there’s always a follower, believer or passionate human being who wants to connect with his poetry and follow in his footsteps. Organisations such as International Pash Memorial Trust and radio and TV channels across the world help keep Pash’s poetry alive.,As the years go by, I have taken the place of my Dadaji by teaching my own children, Armaan and Anayat, about their grandfather and make sure they know who he truly was, his importance, and what powerful poetry he has left behind for the world to read and experience.,If he were alive today, I feel my family would have been living a very different life, but I try my best to live by his words and ideology.,Some of my father’s poems have guided me in some of my most difficult life decisions and I will be forever grateful to him. He has also shaped me into the woman I am today. He has given me and my mother the strength to live on through his words.,His portrait hangs in my living room with the poem ‘Sab Ton Khatarnak’ right beside it. I feel he looks at us every day, making sure we don’t let anyone destroy our dreams. When recently faced with a seemingly insurmountable challenge, this poem carried me through, serving as the wind beneath my wings.,Pash’s poetry provides succour and strength, sustenance and hope to carry forth and guide the next generation to carve its own path. Such powerful and progressive poetry is and should be recognised, celebrated and lived by.","Sep 06, 2020

"I had fever one day. Then breathing became difficult. I told my children about my sickness and that I would isolate myself in my room. Two days later, my Covid-19 test came positive. The medical officer who attended to me said my blood oxygen levels were not too bad, and there were no other serious conditions involved; it would be manageable from home. Her assurance put my mind at ease. The real test, however, was yet to begin.,Even before the lockdown in India, children grasped information on the potentially deadly disease. Thousands of deaths per day in Italy freaked out every household. The number of fatalities was discussed within the family and on phone calls. Adults all over the world consumed macabre stories of bodies piling up on the sidewalks with morning tea. Italy, followed by Spain, and then United States of America, the early information that our fear fed into our children was that the only escape from Covid-19 was death. Little did I know that as soon as I brought my positive diagnosis home, my children would be overwhelmed by the same apprehension.,My elder son, nine years old, could not sleep. His muffled voice reached my room late at night. He feared for his mother. Would she survive? Suddenly, he found himself in a dangerous, inescapable reality that society’s collective fear has built up over the months.,Nothing would happen to me, I told him. Why his mother would be an exception when the rest of the patients had died, he asked. To make the situation worse, my younger son tested positive two days later. Sleep became more elusive to all three of us. It was time for us to talk about Covid-19 from the perspective of survival rate rooted in reason.,According to Johns Hopkins University, the observed case-fatality rate for India is 1.8 per cent, which means 1.8 people die per 100 confirmed positive cases. That is, if the numbers reported are right. I looked it up after testing positive. People who are old and have co-morbidities are at a greater risk of ending up in the aforementioned percentage. Cardiovascular diseases, respiratory conditions and diabetes raise the chances of death by Covid-19. Since I do not have any of these, I was going to be among the 98.2 per 100 confirmed cases that survive. The comparison 98 to 2, for the sake of simplicity, was encouraging.,When chaos rules, control becomes necessary to bullet through difficult time. The younger one, who came out positive, is merely six years old. He said he did not want to die. His fear had foundation, and it was necessary to dismantle it. The foundation was the lack of control over the situation. Control comes through what one believes in. Our belief, in this case, came from the scientific knowledge available at the moment.,We talked about his health in general, and that he did not have symptoms. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 45 per cent of paediatric cases are asymptomatic. Those who require intensive care have underlying health conditions. He did not have any.,Actions set-up in a routine also drive control. Checking the vitals, taking the medication, eating balanced diet, drinking plenty of fluids, taking steam multiple times a day, washing hands, wearing a mask and maintaining physical distance from the rest of the family are some of the tasks that a Covid-19 positive child will have to do on a daily basis. When these tasks are discussed with underlying reason to perform each one, children do take on the responsibility of their own wellbeing pretty diligently. These concrete actions were in his control, and the daily routine based in these actions prevented him from brooding over the popular narrative around Covid-19.,Survival is an empty word without future. Children want to know what they are looking forward to. What will they do after they test negative? Every evening, we talked about the future — travelling, visiting favourite people, and meeting classmates. Life after beating the disease is full of prospects.,It can be tricky to manage the fears of children who have underlying conditions. But again, fear can’t drive the narrative. My older son, who tested negative but has asthma, started taking his condition seriously. He set up his bronco-inhaler, stopped eating cold and icy things, and cleaned his room for allergens. For Covid-19, he mirrored what we were doing.,Reason must prevail over fear. Children need assurance and confirmation that they and their loved ones will sail through the disease. To effectively be the driver of a positive narrative, a parent will have to start from herself first — from scientific knowledge to reason to control. It’s the least we, as parents, can do to channel the chaos around the known and the unknown.","Sep 06, 2020

"Pushpa Girimaji,The mask is certainly uncomfortable, but experts do not recommend face shields as a substitute for masks. They can only be used as an additional precautionary measure along with the mask.,I must mention that earlier, when Covid-19 was believed to spread mainly through large respiratory droplets propelled from the nose or mouth of an infected person, good quality plastic face shields were thought to be quite effective in protecting the wearer as well others. Some scientists even argued that they were better than the mask in blocking respiratory droplets. Besides, they also covered the eyes of the wearer, thereby reducing their exposure to the virus and also prevented the wearer from touching the face with contaminated hands.,However, with growing evidence of airborne transmission of the disease, it is feared that the gaps between the visor and the skin — near the chin and the ears — can allow aerosols or microscopic respiratory droplets carrying the virus to escape from an asymptomatic infected wearer and infect others nearby. The gaps could also expose the wearer to the virus.,So much so that today some of the countries that recommended or allowed face shields as an alternative to masks are now changing their stand. In June, for example, Singapore said its Covid-19 task force had concluded that shields were not as effective as masks. Similarly, in July, Swiss health officials warned citizens against using face shields and said it gave the wearer a false sense of security.,According to media reports, the warning came after an outbreak of Covid-19 in a hotel in the Graubunden region, wherein it was found that hotel employees who wore face shields were infected while those who wore masks were spared. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, US, also says there isn’t enough evidence on the level of protection a face shield offers to people nearby from the spray of respiratory droplets from the wearer.,A recent work on the topic in Physics of Fluids, a journal by the American Institute of Physics on September 1, discourages the use of face shields (and also masks with exhalation valves) and says that their widespread public adoption could have an adverse impact on Covid-19 mitigation efforts.,As of now, or till research to the contrary comes up, face masks score over shields, but along with social distancing and hand hygiene. All the three are extremely important precautions that one should take.,When it comes to face masks, their effectiveness depends on their quality and how they are worn. Even the best of masks will fail if they are loose, leaving large gaps between the face and the mask or covering only the mouth and not the nose.,As far as quality is concerned, several studies have recommended three-layered masks made of different fabrics with varying mechanical and electrostatic filtering properties, for maximum efficiency. Accordingly, the World Health Organisation recommends an inner hydrophilic material such as knitted cotton, a middle polypropylene layer for good filtration and an outer hydrophobic material such as polyester or a blend of polyester and cotton to repel droplets and moisture.,I must also mention that despite the health ministry’s warning, several people use masks with exhale valves. This may protect the wearer, but can affect others. In fact, the abovementioned research paper in Physics of Fluids also looked at masks with exhale valves and said they “significantly reduced the effectiveness of a mask as a means of source control as a large number of droplets (expelled by the wearer) pass through the valve unfiltered”.,So wear a good quality mask, without valves, properly. And for extra protection, you can wear the shield over it.","Sep 20, 2020

"Ajey Kumar is a poet from Sumnam village in Lahaul. His poems have appeared in noted Hindi literary journals such as Pahal, Gyanodaya, Tadbhav, Akaar and Kathadesh.,Ishan Marvel hails from Marbal village in Lahaul. His debut book Exit One was published in 2018.,(Translated by Marvel from the original poem ‘Pahaad’ by Ajey),: A powerful poem like ‘Pahaad’ can often tell us more about a situation than a hundred factual books. Given that the Rohtang Tunnel is finally about to be inaugurated, could you share how you conceived the first stanza in 1996?,: Back then, everyone believed the tunnel was an empty dream. Very few people were actively fighting for it, and I was witness to these efforts, particularly by Tshering Dorjeji. Meanwhile, we organised an exhibition of paintings of Sukh Dass, who is fondly known as ‘Guruji’ across Lahaul, at Keylong. There were no portraits — just our mountains in all their silent, expressionless glory. It is these mountains that I’m referring to in the poem, for something clicked in my head at that exhibition, and the opening question emerged: ‘Par Zara Socho Guruji.’ But just think Guruji.,: Even if people were not fighting for it, they did want the tunnel, right?,: Of course. Who wants to be cut off from the world for six months in snow? Plus, the crops would reach the market and not go waste.,Heavy snow on Rohtang Pass cuts off Lahaul-Spiti from the rest of the world for at least six months during winter. Opening of the tunnel (now called Atal Tunnel) would change that. It would ensure connectivity with Kullu throughout the year, making things easier for locals who have been bearing the brunt of the weather, especially in case of medical exigencies. Foundation stone of the project was laid in 2009 and work began two years later.,: So why is the poet unhappy?,: The poet’s concerns are different. He feels the gravity of such things more acutely. And since action is not his domain, he can only express these feelings and raise questions even if he doesn’t have the answers. To raise them in such a piercing manner that people are forced to find answers, or at least think about them, that is my motive as a poet.,: How did you feel when PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee made the announcement in 2000?,: Vajpayee already supported the tunnel from a defence perspective, since it would provide an all-weather route to Ladakh. Then, in 1999, the Kargil War happened. Next year, the PM was in Keylong to make the official announcement. Amid all this, my poetic voice became trivial for I couldn’t find a single person who agreed with my views. Looking at the public consensus, I realised that perhaps it was the mountain’s own decision to get pierced. So all I could muster was that single line: ‘Pahaad, kya tum chhid jaoge?’,: You added another line this year, and there is a clear sense of hurt.,: I was and still am hurt that our mountains have been pierced. This abrupt model of development that we are blindly trying to implement across the world is especially harmful for vulnerable ecosystems and indigenous cultures like ours. Development must happen at a natural pace so that the people and the land get time to adapt. It’s not just a question of the environment, or loss of natural beauty and culture. I’m talking about losing our Lahauliyat.,: What do you mean by that?,: The essence of the people and the land. You can still find it in our peripheral villages. I have understood glimpses of it in the tales of Gyapo Gesar that we used to hear from our elders. I feel Gesar’s character embodies Lahauliyat — his innocence, sensitivity and presence of mind combined with his witty, carefree and romantic nature, and his antipathy towards the elite and his glorification of the ‘ordinary’. He embodies the best of what a rustic, pastoral consciousness can offer. To me, that is Lahauliyat.,: It’s sad that our generation missed out on these oral traditions.,: Then let me tell you a Gesar story about how Rohtang Pass came into existence. Once there was an evil king in Kullu, and it fell upon Gesar to go on his flying horse and destroy the tyrant. However, the Pir Panjal mountains were too high even for the magic horse. So, Gesar struck the mountains with his whip and Rohtang Pass came into being. As he raised his whip again, his aunt Kurman appeared from the heavens and stopped him. She explained that the Pass was enough, for if he struck the mountains again, Ling (Trans-Himalayas) and Mon (Indian Himalayas) would become one. So you see how our ancestors adapted the Trans-Himalayan epic to reflect their wisdom about maintaining limited connectivity with the outer world? It was a matter of preserving our Lahauliyat!,: Maybe that’s where the balance lies — embracing modernity on one’s own terms, according to one’s own context, and without letting go off one’s roots.,: Exactly! Now, we have undone our forefathers’ wisdom. And instead of just celebrating the practical gains, we should also be focussing on the negative prospects to try and find sustainable solutions. Not much is happening in that direction, and that’s what I feel sad about.,: You think Ling and Mon will become one now, as in, would Lahaul become another Manali?,: It is only a matter of time, depending on how our people and our leadership deal with this monster called ‘Vikas’.","Sep 20, 2020

"HARVESTING has commenced for the paddy crop and so has the burning of its stubble. The government machinery is counselling farmers and informing them about the availability of straw management machinery to curb farm fires. However, farmers and farm unions are saying that they do not have any financially viable option to dispose of the stubble, so the farm fires will continue this year. ,A senior officer, requesting anonymity, admits: “Nothing can stop stubble burning until all parties, including the department of agriculture, the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) and the farmers work out an acceptable-to-all solution. Any solution, ultimately, will need the nod of the Centre. And this does not look like happening.”  ,A farmer from Lehra Bega village in Bathinda district, Gurtej Singh, says, “Fires have already started and you will see them all over Punjab in the coming days. We are made to spend extra on clearing stubble from our fields after the harvest, without any financial support, which makes farming unviable. We need machines and labour.”,Official figures say the government provided about 51,000 machines on subsidy under the Crop Residue Management Scheme for the management of paddy residue during 2018-19 and 2019-20. Dr Manjit Singh, head of department of farm machinery at Punjab Agricultural University (Ludhiana), says the state government has received about 77,000 applications this year for just 23,500 machines, showing greater interest among farmers for the stubble disposal machines.,Experts say the state has about 200 lakh tonnes of paddy stubble to manage each year. Going by the sheer volume of the work, farmers need to be incentivised by the government. Member secretary, PPCB, Karunesh Garg, says, “It is too early to give any figures for the farm fires this year. Data formulation will start around September 23.”,Data from NASA shows that in November 2016, the number of crop residue fires was 51,150 in Punjab, but it came down to 28,078 next year during the same period. It rose to 39,231 in 2018 and fell to 26,260 in 2019.  There were reports of rampant burning of wheat stubble in April-May this year. ,Delhi has been complaining for long about the bad quality of its air during particular months. Punjab is blamed as the biggest offender. Punjab’s fires are bigger in number compared to adjoining states primarily because the area under paddy cultivation is more. In 2018-19, the area was 31 lakh hectares, while in Haryana it was 14.45 lakh hectares. This year, Punjab has about 27 lakh hectares under paddy.,Bharti Kisan Union (Ugrahan) leader Ram Singh Bhainibaga says, “Unless there are financially viable alternatives for the already distressed farmers, paddy stubble will be burnt. We have time and again demanded a bonus of Rs 200 per quintal for the crop residue, which works to be about Rs 6,500 per acre. Otherwise, at the current rate of payment, a farmer saves little.” ,Farmers who are found  burning paddy are liable to be booked under Section 188 (disobedience to order promulgated by a public servant) of the Indian Penal Code. An offender can be sentenced to a term of one month along with a fine. ,A senior officer says in 2019, 3,141 challans were issued for recovering around Rs 40 lakh on account of burning paddy. As many as 322 farmers were booked under FIRs. And a red pen entry was made against the names of 510 farmers, which means that they will not be able to avail special government benefits in future. ,The state has earmarked special sites in the districts for the collection of crop residue on common land/cattle pounds and gaushalas where farmers can store paddy straw. This stored basmati residue can be transported to places where it can be used as cattle fodder. The state already has 11 biomass power projects generating 97.50 MW. These are consuming about 8.8 lakh metric tonnes of paddy residue per annum. ,At least two more projects are planned. Eight bio-CNG and one bio-ethanol projects, using paddy straw, are likely to be commissioned between March 2021 and December 2022.","Sep 21, 2020

"The world is recovering: not only from a debilitating pandemic but also from the ruinous effect it is having on the economy. It inevitably sent the world’s fourth largest automotive market into a cautious crawl — an industry that accounts for almost half of the country’s manufacturing GDP. But the good news is that if reports from last month are any indication, the signs are of a steady recovery, albeit slow. From what was a dismal 40,000 in May, the number of cars sold has risen to almost 2,26,000 in August, bucking the downward trend with a reassuring 7.5 per cent growth. Kia and Maruti have emerged as beacons of possibility and consistency, respectively. The Korean brand jumped from being the 15th largest automotive brand to the fifth, with a breathtaking 64 per cent growth, while Maruti reiterated market leadership with an 18.8 per cent growth.,As car brands pat the dust off their waiting stock and make space for new arrivals in showrooms, we have new model launches and facelifts to look forward to. As to be expected, the market setback has pushed some of them towards a later date. Even as they announced the Thar with great fanfare, Mahindra has reserved the XUV300 Turbo Sportz variant for early 2021; just what Tata has done with their 7-seat Gravitas. The price segment of Rs10 lakh-Rs15 lakh (ex-showroom) is, perhaps, the most interesting as we come across models in a variety of styles and sizes — from five to nine seat configurations and from hatchbacks and sedans to crossovers and SUVs. So, from this exciting array of recent and upcoming cars that are BS6 compliant, we have picked 10 models that can make 2020 actually look good!,Kia Seltos is still rather new. The echoes haven’t settled, of the uproar it created when more than 32,000 of them were sold even before its launch. Yet, Kia has now updated the feature list with improved voice assist, smartwatch connectivity and remote engine start that justify the hike in price by up to Rs25,000 for the petrol variant and up to Rs30,000 for the diesel.Seltos now comes with three engine options, all BS6-compliant: a 1.5-litre petrol (115PS/144Nm), 1.4L turbocharged petrol (140PS/242Nm), and 1.5L diesel (115PS/ 250Nm). The turbo engine is set apart for the GT Line variants with a 6-speed manual gearbox or a 7-speed dual clutch transmission. What differentiates Seltos in the segment are the available safety and comfort features like a 10.25” touch screen, an 8” head up display,six airbags, ABS with EBD, electronic stability control (ESC), hill assist control (HAC) and a 360º parking camera.,Sibling rivalry is benevolent when it inspires excellence. Within three months of its launch, the new Creta has clocked 30,000 bookings, which is uncannily similar to what Kia Seltos achieved. The Creta, too, is available with an array of three engines — a 1.5-litre petrol, a 1.4-litre petrol turbo GDi and a 1.5-litre U2 CRDi diesel. The compact SUV promises an engaging drive with modes like eco, comfort and sport, besides traction control modes like snow, sand and mud. In its first major upgrade, the Creta gets an all-new front fascia, refreshed tail lights and a range of safety features like rear-view camera and rear parking assist. It showcases some industry-firsts like remote engine start and impressive features like voice-activated sunroof, an inbuilt air purifier and wireless charging.,It turns out that BS6 implementation gave Maruti-Suzuki the chance to not only comply with emission norms but also to respond to a longstanding demand from consumers — a petrol engine for the S-Cross. So, Maruti has replaced the 1.3L diesel engine with a new BS6 compliant 1.5L petrol engine, which has a power output of 105 PS and 138 Nm of torque — the same engine that drives the Ciaz and the Vitara Brezza. Another landmark change in the new S-Cross 2020 is the introduction of an automatic transmission. Maruti’s K-series petrol engine also offers smart hybrid technology with both the 4-speed automatic and 5-speed manual. Keeping the current list of features unchanged, S-Cross 2020 adds a 7-inch touchscreen with android auto and Apple carplay, while standard safety includes dual front airbags, ABS with EBD, and rear parking sensors.,As Mahindra Thar enters a new generation, the familiar design is refreshed just enough to build a modern identity for the SUV while making sure not to alienate “Jeep-lovers”. Perched on a brand new platform, new Mahindra Thar is 65mm longer with a 20 mm longer wheelbase. With 4-wheel drive as standard, the new Thar has made dimensional changes that encourage one to take the road less travelled more often, like its 650 mm wading depth, modern multi-link suspensions and ground clearance that has increased from 200 mm to 226mm on newly fitted 18” tyres. For the first time, Thar gets a petrol engine and this 2.0L turbo charged four pot makes 150 PS while the 2.2L diesel now makes 130. The drivetrain offers two new transmission options — a 6-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual!,If looks can inspire adventure, Mahindra Thar and rival Force Gurkha have been doing that over the years. A single-slat grille and rounded headlamps are still a part of the tall and slender presence that reminds one of the ‘Gelandewagen,’ but the new model will feature LED DRLs, new bumpers and turn indicators on the front fenders. A new roof-mounted carrier and 17-inch alloy wheels add more adventurous proportions to the profile. The SUV sticks to its ladder-on-frame construction but would likely have contemporary equipment like a touchscreen infotainment system, power windows, dual front airbags and ABS. The BS6 compliant 2020 Force Gurkha turns to a 2.6 L diesel engine from Mercedes-Benz that still generates 89 bhp but is rich in torque at 280 Nm. Off-roading aficionados can look forward to a 5-speed manual gearbox and a manual 4×4 system.,If you fancy the reliability of a Maruti Vitara Brezza with Toyota enhancements, the upcoming Urban Cruiser is the one to watch out for! Toyota’s first under-4m crossover, the Urban Cruiser will be available in three trim levels, all powered by the original 1.5 L K-series petrol engine mated to a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic. Interestingly, the automatic variants feature the advanced Li-ion battery technology from Maruti with regenerative braking and idle start-stop functions for improved fuel economy. The impressive specs in the higher variants include LED lighting in front and rear, ABS with EBD, rear parking sensors, a 7-inch smartplay touchscreen infotainment unit with Apple carplay and android auto, and other conveniences in connectivity.,The French brand that made SUV dreams feasible for the average Indian car buyers has just brought another dream within reach — the desire for a powerful SUV. Renault Duster Turbo became the most powerful SUV in its segment when the variant powered by a 1.3L turbo petrol engine was launched last month. Its 154 Hp output and torque of 254 Nm will be delivered to the wheels by either a manual transmission or an X-Tronic CVT. However, this car is not just about power. Technologies such as gasoline direct injection (GDI) improves performance and efficiency while dual variable valve timing (VVT) facilitates higher torque at lower rpm while keeping emissions lower.,Hector is the “Internet car” that connected Indian consumers to MG Motors. In 2020, the three-row, six-seat version of the Hector has been launched, with the two relaxing captain’s seats in the second row expected to appeal to those who prefer to be chauffeur-driven in an SUV. Features like the multi-function steering wheel, 10.4-inch touchscreen, 6 airbags and 360º camera are similar to that of the 5-seater but what is different is the hands-free opening of the tailgate and the ‘chit chat’ alerts in the connected vehicle tech. The drivetrain combinations include a 170hp, 2.0-litre diesel engine mated to a 6-speed manual gearbox and a 143Hp, 1.5-litre turbo-petrol that offers the option of a 6-speed dual clutch transmission. The latter can also be paired with a 48V mild-hybrid system.,Honda has invigorated the fifth generation of the Honda City with enough lifestyle-empowering technology, besides offering three fuel-efficient variants. A 1.5L petrol engine that makes 121 PS and 145 Nm torque mated to a 6-speed manual transmission or a 7-step CVT; a 1.5L diesel engine generating 100 PS and 200 Nm mated to a 6-speed manual. The new Honda City sparkles with LED lights but the most impressive tech is in the cabin: like an 8-inch touch screen infotainment system that offers android auto, Apple carplay and weblink support; ambient lighting; Amazon Alexa remote control and connected car technology; and safety features like Honda’s very own lane watch camera that relays what is beside your car while changing lanes!,Among the upcoming cars of 2020, Tata Altroz is special — an electric vehicle that falls in the Rs12 lakh- Rs15 lakh bracket, alongside the electric versions of Mahindra XUV300 and Tata Nexon (with whom the Altroz EV shares the powertrain). Driven by a 95kW motor, the Altroz will draw its power from a 30kWh Li-ion battery that can give the car a range of more than 300 km. Tata expects 80 per cent of charging to happen in less than an hour, which goes a long way in making long trips time-efficient.","Sep 20, 2020

"For someone who did not go to any theatre or film institute to learn the art of acting, being appointed as chairperson of the prestigious National School of Drama (NSD) in New Delhi has come as a “very pleasant surprise”. Veteran actor Paresh Rawal, whose appointment was announced by the President last week, says the news came like a breath of fresh air in these corona-ridden times, when almost every industry and profession has suffered a severe setback.,“For any artiste, big or small, the future looks bleak, and this situation, if one were to look at things conservatively, is likely to continue till February-March. Of course, the optimist in me would say ‘kal parson khatam ho jayega’, but we’d be living in a fool’s paradise to imagine that the end of Covid-19 is just round the corner,” says the 65-year-old Padma Shri awardee. Rawal’s been essaying his roles of an actor and a politician — he was a Member of Parliament in the Lok Sabha from 2014-2019 (“but politics and political affiliations must be kept away from art”) — with considerable ease. But, on a positive note, he perks up, “Covid aa jaye, cholera aa jaye, live entertainment will never go out of style.”,Still in Mumbai — given the “sad situation of the way the virus is spreading here” — Rawal plans to get to Delhi for the four-year stint as early as possible. “I am raring to go,” says the seasoned actor. And he refuses to be intimidated by the fact that he will be doing administrative work for the first time. “I am already working towards having a good team, starting with an excellent director, of like-minded people to give shape to my plans and our collective vision for theatre.”,And one of these includes taking theatre to every city of India. “NSD must not be restricted only to Delhi. We must have similar institutes in other cities, too, for not every talented person — like say Manoj Bajpayee or Irrfan Khan — has the means to come to NSD,” states Rawal. There was a time, he recalls, when in the early 1970s, many youngsters like him learnt about NSD only when Naseeruddin Shah, Om Puri and Pankaj Kapoor blazed onto the film firmament. “Now more awareness needs to spread and we must also connect with universities and colleges to offer our talented force, even in the remote regions, a platform to hone their talent and skills,” he adds.,Good theatre, too, needs to travel to every Indian city. “We need to expose audiences to plays that make them think,” says the actor. And while the theatre-going crowd maybe mature and censorship may not be required, a certain amount of self-restraint is essential while exercising creative freedom,” says the NSD chief who is currently working on three plays. “The moment the lockdown is lifted, I shall get onto the stage with them,” smiles the veteran actor who has always garnered rave reviews not just for his work in Marathi and Gujarati theatre, but also in films with a repertoire that ranges from commercial fare, including Mohra and Hera Pheri on the one hand, and critically acclaimed movies such as Woh Chokri and Sardar on the other. Those who’ve seen him essay the role of the Iron Man of India wouldn’t be surprised to learn that Sardar figures in his list of personal favourites — the others being Road to Sangam, Mumbai Meri Jaan and Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye!,Straddling the worlds of theatre and films — and doing them well — is all a result of passion. “Sab balance ho jata hai. In fact, you can pack in a lot more if you have the will,” he smiles. And although all his roles, many may argue, seem tailor-made for him, Rawal says he never allows himself to take any of his characters lightly. “More so, when you always seem to be pitted against a superb, bright crop of actors, but isi mein to mazaa hai,” he smiles, talking about Nawazuddin Siddiqui (“uska to kya kehna”), Rajkummar Rao and Pankaj Tripathi, among many others. “Working with them is like a wake-up call each time — it reminds you to always keep pulling up your socks”.,While on the subject of bright young actors, he mentions Sushant Singh Rajput, “such a talented youngster who’s gone too soon”. Impressed with his work in films such as Kai Po Che! and Sonchiriya particularly, Rawal remembers his brief meeting with Rajput not too far back. “Even in those 15 or so minutes that we chatted, he came across as very bright and positive, with a philosophical approach to life.”,Self-made actors such as him are to be admired, says Rawal, whose brush with theatre started in 1972 when he was barely 17. “Just watching good Marathi and Gujarati theatre helped me make a start. Soon after I got onto the stage, I started picking up the nuances not just of acting but also of direction, lighting and stage-setting,” he states.,He remembers, “Back then, the maahaul of Marathi and Gujarati theatre scene was very vibrant and motivating — with people like Girish Karnad, among many others, at the helm”. And when Prithvi Theatre came up in 1978, “it became Kashi, Mecca, Medina for theatre aficionados like us”. That is why, he stresses, while films and web-series may rule the roost in these times of Covid-19, theatre will bounce back, for, “there’s nothing like performing live in front of an engaging audience”.","Sep 20, 2020

"WITH the onset of paddy harvesting amid the Covid-19 crisis, the Haryana government has chalked out a plan to check stubble burning, a major contributor to air pollution that chokes the national capital region in the winter. Apart from planning to establish more custom hiring centres (CHCs) to provide high-end equipment for crop residue management to farmers, the Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Department has categorised the fields as red, orange and green zones, based on the active fire locations detected by the Haryana Space Applications Centre (HARSAC) in the last paddy season.,Data shows 3,911 active fire locations were detected in the state from April 15 to May 31 this year, compared to 7,383 cases last year in the same period. A total of 6,630 such locations were identified during the last paddy season against 10,286 in 2018.,Villages with six or more active fire locations have been kept in the red category, those with 2-5 locations in the orange zone and those with fewer locations in the green zone. As many as 332 villages of the state are in the red zone and 673 in the orange zone.,In order to ensure better management of stubble in the fields while harvesting, almost all district administrations in Haryana have made the installation of the straw management system (SMS) in combine harvesters mandatory. Combine harvesters operating without SMS will be impounded and the operators fined. “The SDM will issue a certificate after ensuring that the SMS is attached,” says Nishant Kumar Yadav, Deputy Commissioner, Karnal.,To bring down the incidents of stubble burning this season, a strict vigil will be kept, especially on the villages in the red and orange zones. Agriculture officials, with the help of officials of several other departments, including Panchayati Raj, police, revenue and the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), will not only keep a vigil but also make the farmers aware of the proper management of stubble. Nodal officers have also been appointed to check the menace of stubble burning.,“Local-level committees are being constituted to keep an eye on the erring farmers,” says Sanjeev Kaushal, Additional Chief Secretary, Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Department.,Kaushal is hopeful that the plan will help in reducing the number of stubble burning cases to a great extent.,The department has fixed a target of establishing around 2,000 more CHCs this season. “We have set up 2,879 CHCs in the state since 2018,” says Jagmander Nain, Joint Director (Agricultural Engineering). These CHCs will also help the farming community in better management of paddy straw.,However, a farmers’ body says these steps are not sufficient for small and marginal farmers. “Farmers won’t burn stubble if they get machines for the better management of stubble without any rent. The Union government had once announced to set up straw procurement centres to motivate farmers, but nobody knows what happened to the project. The government should open such purchase centres so that instead of burning the stubble, farmers can manage it and further sell it in the market,” says Rattan Mann, president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU-Mann). He says the number of CHCs and machines is inadequate.,Experts say stubble burning contributes significantly to air pollution, with the period between October 15 and November 15 being critical. Dr Rakesh Bhardwaj, Principal, Banwari Lal Jindal Suiwala College, Tosham, and an environmentalist, says the farmers need to be made aware of the respiratory problems caused by stubble burning and the various industrial uses of rice/wheat stubble. He fears that the worsening of air quality might aggravate the Covid-19 crisis.","Sep 21, 2020

"Pushpesh Pant,No, there is no dearth of desi corn recipes. The most famous perhaps is makki ki roti paired with sarson ka saag from Punjab. In Malwa region of Madhya Pradesh, locals take pride in the kees prepared from sweet corn kernels. Vegetarians now get to order bhutte ka kebab in restaurants. Makki ka halwa and kheer are, however, rare. Himachal Pradesh has an entire festival dedicated to corn — Minjar. Nepalese prepare a porridge-like dish, dhedho, from corn.,We owe our recipe this week to our friend, ex-MLA Ranjit Rawat. He treated us to a delicious makki ka chila for breakfast last year. Ranjit bhai remembered his childhood days nostalgically as he narrated how the villagers in his native Salt (also known as Sult) region for long subsisted on corn pancakes as nothing else grew easily.,Not difficult to master, you can try it at home.
