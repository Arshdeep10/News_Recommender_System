"Seoul, September 26,South Korea urged North Korea on Saturday to further investigate the fatal shooting of a South Korean fisheries official and suggested it could be a joint probe by the two sides, as public and political outrage over the killing grew.,The move came as a rare apology from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un appears to have failed to soothe criticism over the Moon government's handling over the accident.,After a National Security Council meeting last evening, South Korea's presidential office said it would call for a joint probe into the case with the North if needed, saying there were discrepancies in accounts of the accident from the two sides.,South Korea's military said on Thursday that the North's soldiers killed the man, doused his body in fuel and set it on fire near the sea border.,But the North Korean government said in a message on Friday that its soldiers shot the ""illegal intruder"" and denied burning his body.,In the message, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was quoted as offering an apology for disappointing his counterpart Moon Jae-in and the South Korean people.,The main opposition People Power Party said on Saturday Kim’s apology was not genuine, calling on the Moon government to send the case to the International Criminal Court and the US Security Council.,The Moon administration faces an intense political backlash over how it responded to the incident, which coincided with a renewed push by the president for engagement with Pyongyang.,Critics accused Moon of failing to save a citizen's life and being soft on North Korea, saying the military did not attempt to save him despite spotting him six hours before he was shot dead.,""Peace is important in inter-Korean relations, but the most important thing is the lives of our people.

"A young man stabbed two people on Friday outside the former Paris offices of satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, where 12 people were killed in 2015, and a terrorism investigation has been opened into the new attack, authorities said.,The suspected assailant had been arrested a month ago for carrying a screwdriver but was not on police radar for Islamic radicalization, France’s interior minister said. He said the screwdriver was considered a weapon, but did not explain why.,Two people were wounded in Friday’s attack, and two suspects were arrested, although the links between the two suspects weren’t immediately clear.,The main suspect, a young man with speckles of blood on his forehead and wearing orange gym shoes, was arrested on the steps of the Bastille Opera in eastern Paris, authorities said.,The site is not far from where Friday’s attack took place, outside the building where the weekly Charlie Hebdo was located before the 2015 attack.,The interior minister said the assailant arrived in France three years ago as an unaccompanied minor, apparently from Pakistan, but his identity was still being verified.,“Manifestly it’s an act of Islamist terrorism,” Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said in an interview with public broadcaster France-2.,“Obviously, there is little doubt. It’s a new bloody attack against our country, against journalists, against this society.”   ,France’s counterterrorism prosecutor said earlier that authorities suspect a terrorist motive because of the place and timing of the stabbings: in front of the building where Charlie Hebdo was based until the Islamic extremist attack on its cartoonists, and at a time when suspects in the 2015 attack are on trial across town.,Prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard said that the chief suspect in Friday’s stabbings was arrested, along with another person.,Ricard said the assailant did not know the people stabbed, a woman and a man working at a documentary production company who had stepped outside for a smoke break.,An investigation was opened into “attempted murder in relation with a terrorist enterprise”, according to the terrorism prosecutor’s office.,French Prime Minister Jean Castex said the lives of the two wounded workers were not in danger.,He offered the government’s solidarity with their families and colleagues.,The prime minister noted the “symbolic site” of the attack, “at the very moment where the trial into the atrocious acts against Charlie Hebdo is under way”. ,He promised the government’s “unfailing attachment to freedom of the press, and its determination to fight terrorism”.                 ,People in the neighbourhood were stunned, saying on French TV that they were reliving the nightmare of the newsroom massacre.,In a tweet, Charlie Hebdo strongly condemned the stabbings.,“This tragic episode shows us once again that fanaticism, intolerance, the origins of which will be revealed by the investigation, are still present in French society....There is no question of ceding anything,” the newspaper said.,The two people confirmed injured worked for documentary film company Premieres Lignes, according to founder Paul Moreira. He told France’s BFM television that the attacker fled into the subway, and the company’s staff members were evacuated.,Moreira said a man in the street “attacked two people who were in front of the building, didn’t enter the building, and who attacked them with an axe and who left.” He said the company had not received any threats.,His colleague, Luc Hermann, describing witnesses’ version of the attack, said the assailant first struck the woman in her face, then the man, before returning to attack the woman again.,“The whole team ... took refuge on the roof of the building like our team did five years ago during the attack of Charlie Hebdo,” he said on France-2.,He said it was “incomprehensible” that authorities had not taken special security precautions particularly at this time.,A wrenching, two-month trial in the Charlie Hebdo attacks is currently unfolding at the main Paris courthouse. Murmurs broke at the terrorism trial of 14 people, including 3 fugitives, accused of helping the attackers in the January 2015 killings, as the news filtered through.,The widows of the two brothers who forced their way into the newspaper’s offices and opened fire at a morning editorial meeting testified Friday.,Caty Richard, a lawyer for the Charlie Hebdo journalists, heard about the knife attack in the midst of the trial.,“My first thought was this will never end,” she said. “I am devastated, angry.” ,The interior minister conceded that security was lacking on the street where Charlie Hebdo was once headquartered. He said that 775 police protect its new location.,But “there was an attack so we could have done better”, he said.

"Topeka (US), September 26,A state university president in Kansas whose decision in June to cancel a virtual speech by Ivanka Trump angered donors and others resigned Friday, after less than a year in the job.,The Board of Regents, which oversees Kansas’ higher education system, did not say why Wichita State University President Jay Golden stepped down, offering no details on what led up to it.,The university received national attention — and plenty of criticism — for dropping a virtual speech by President Donald Trump’s elder daughter for its technical school graduation.,“The Board is thankful for his service,” a statement from Bill Feuerborn, the regents’ chairman, said.,“We are appreciative of his hard work and dedication to the university and are grateful for his commitment to serving students.,“We wish him well in all his future endeavors.” Wichita State referred questions to a Board of Regents spokesman who did not return a telephone message from The Associated Press.,A home phone number for Golden could not be found.,Regent Jon Rolph, a Wichita restaurateur, told The Wichita Eagle that Golden’s resignation was not related to the Ivanka Trump controversy.,“Being a part of the conversations around accepting Jay’s resignation today, that was clear,” he said.,However, Rolph said state privacy laws prohibit him from discussing the circumstances of the resignation, but added that there was “no impropriety.”      ,Golden cancelled Ivanka Trump’s speech after students and faculty protested.,Steve Clark, a former Kansas regent from Wichita, sought Golden’s ouster in June and sent a letter then to board members saying Golden’s decision to cancel the speech by Ivanka Trump threatened a multimillion-dollar relationship with Koch Industries, the vast conglomerate led by billionaire and conservative political donor Charles Koch.,Clark said Friday that Golden, who previously served as vice-chancellor and professor of engineering at East Carolina University in North Carolina, “wasn’t a good cultural fit for our Midwest values here.” ,“I don’t think he was very good at balancing the interests of all the university stakeholders, the students, alums, faculty and donors and considering all things,” Clark said.,“I think it’s better for him and much better for the university.”                 ,Clark is the chairman and CEO of a Wichita investment firm and served as chairman of search committees for both Golden and his predecessor, John Bardo.,Golden became president in January, after Bardo died in March 2019.,Clark told the regents in June that canceling Trump’s speech damaged the school’s reputation with high-profile donors and relationships could be restored only if Golden left.,“There were numerous issues,” Clark said Friday.,“There were a lot of people upset at the Trump decision. He had his own agenda and he appeared to maybe not take, as I said, all stakeholders’ interests into consideration.”        ,But Kansas House Minority Leader Tom Sawyer, a Wichita Democrat, said the announcement caught him by surprise and that Golden appeared to be popular with students.,“I certainly hope it has nothing to do with the Trump thing,” he said.,“I would be disappointed if somebody would lose their job over that.”                 ,Wichita State has 14,000 students, including some 3,000 at its technical school and is home to a national institute on aviation research.,Parts of Wichita and its suburbs are politically conservative, and Donald Trump carried the county in 2016 by 18 percentage points.

"Washington, September 26,President Donald Trump plans to announce conservative federal appeals court judge Amy Coney Barrett on Saturday as his Supreme Court nominee, two sources said on Friday, as he moves to shift it further to the right and sets up a heated Senate confirmation fight with Democrats 5-1/2 weeks before the US election.,If confirmed by the Senate, which is controlled by Trump’s fellow Republicans, Barrett would replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal icon who died at age 87 on Sept. 18. Barrett is a favorite of religious conservatives, a key Trump constituency, and he has asked the Senate to confirm her before the November 3 election in which he is seeking a second term and Democrats are aiming to seize control of the chamber.,Barrett, 48, was appointed by Trump to the Chicago-based 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals in 2017. If confirmed to the lifetime post, she would become the fifth woman ever to serve on the high court while expanding its conservative majority to a rock-solid 6-3.,Her selection was viewed with alarm by liberal advocacy groups. Abortion rights groups have expressed concern that on the Supreme Court Barrett could help overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide.,Catherine Glenn Foster, president and CEO of the anti-abortion group Americans United For Life, praised Trump for making a “brave and ambitious choice” and called Barrett “the best and most qualified successor” to Ginsburg.,The other finalist mentioned by Trump to fill the vacancy was Barbara Lagoa, a Cuban-American federal appeals court judge from Florida who he appointed last year and who potentially could have boosted his chances in the key election battleground state. Trump said he did not meet with Lagoa during a campaign trip to Florida. He met with Barrett on Monday.,Trump plans a formal introduction of his nominee at the White House on Saturday. Two sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that Trump plans to nominate Barrett, but cautioned that he could change his mind. Trump told reporters on Friday he had made his decision, but declined to reveal it.,Barrett previously served as a clerk to conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016.,As an appellate judge, Barrett has staked out conservative legal positions on key hot-button issues in three years on the bench, voting in favor of one of Trump’s hardline immigration policies and showing support for expansive gun rights. She also authored a ruling making it easier for college students accused of campus sexual assaults to sue their institutions.,Trump’s nominee has what appears to be a clear path to Senate confirmation, with Republicans holding a 53-47 majority in the chamber and only two senators in his party indicating opposition to moving forward with the process.,Democrats have objected to the Senate acting on Trump’s nominee in light of the decision by Republicans in the chamber in 2016 to refuse to consider Democratic President Barack Obama’s nominee to replace Scalia after he died during a presidential election year.,GINSBURG HONORED,Ginsburg, a champion of gender equality and various liberal causes, made history again on Friday as the first woman and first Jewish person to lie in state in the U.S. Capitol.,Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden attended the ceremony a day after Trump was greeted with jeers and boos by a nearby crowd as he visited Ginsburg’s flag-draped coffin outside the Supreme Court building.,“If she is nominated and confirmed, Coney Barrett would work to dismantle all that Ruth Bader Ginsburg fought for during her extraordinary career,” said Alphonso David, president of the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT advocacy group. “An appointment of this magnitude must be made by the president inaugurated in January.”,Trump this week said he believed the Supreme Court would be called upon to rule on the election outcome, something that has happened only once in American history, in 2000.,“I think it’s very important that we have nine justices,” Trump said on Wednesday.,Trump has repeatedly and without evidence said that voting by mail, a longstanding feature of American politics, could lead to a surge in election fraud.,THIRD TRUMP APPOINTEE,Barrett would be his third Supreme Court appointment. Like Trump’s two other conservative appointees, Neil Gorsuch in 2017 and Brett Kavanaugh in 2018, Barrett potentially could serve for decades, placing a conservative stamp on Supreme Court precedent.,The court’s decisions exert vast influence on American life, and a solidly conservative court could limit abortion rights, expand religious rights, strike down gun control laws and uphold new restrictions on voting rights.,On Nov. 10, the court is scheduled to hear arguments in a major case in which Trump and fellow Republicans are seeking to invalidate the 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. If confirmed by then, the nominee could cast a decisive vote.,The nomination could help Trump cement a key part of his presidential legacy - making the federal judiciary move conservative - while also energizing his core supporters ahead of the election.,The Senate under the U.S. Constitution is given the power to confirm or reject a president’s judicial nominees. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has given a high priority to winning confirmation of Trump’s conservative judicial selections. Reuters","Sep 26, 2020

We won’t forget it. We closed up, we saved millions of lives. Now we’ve opened up, opening with records,” he said.,The US is the worst-affected country from the virus.

The US on September 14 banned the import of five goods from China, including computer-parts, cotton and hair products, alleging that they are produced in forced labour camps in the restive Muslim-majority Xinjiang province.,Trump, addressing thousands of his supporters at a local airport in the backdrop of Air Force One, said that post-coronavirus relationship with China does not mean much to him and expressed his deep disappointment with the Chinese.,“I had a very good relationship in China with President Xi (Jinping). But you know what? This pandemic has just... we made a great trade deal, but it just doesn’t mean the same to me. Does that make any sense? It doesn’t mean the same to me. It doesn’t mean the same to me,” Trump said.,The president said that early this month, China had the largest order of corn to American farmers in US history. They had the largest order of soybeans and a massive order of beef.,“But you know what it does just doesn’t mean as much to me now, as it did, at one point,” he said.,“The ink wasn’t even dry on the trade deal. And this thing came in.

"Terre Haute, September 24,The US government executed convicted murderer Christopher Vialva on Thursday, the first Black man to suffer the federal death penalty since the punishment was resumed this summer after a 17-year hiatus.,Vialva was 19 years old when he and fellow members of a gang in Killeen, Texas, killed Todd and Stacie Bagley, white married Christian youth ministers from Iowa, on the Fort Hood army base in 1999.,He was pronounced dead at 6:46 pm after the US Department of Justice officials injected him with pentobarbital, a barbiturate, at the execution chamber in Terre Haute, Indiana, according to reporter serving as a media witness.,Vialva, a Messianic Jew, used his last words to ask God to comfort his victims’ families, according to the media witness.,“Heal their hearts with grace and love,” he said, “I’m ready, Father.” After the injections began, he furrowed his brow, yawned and looked toward the witness room from which his mother was expected to view his execution. Within minutes, he stopped moving, his mouth agape.,It was the sixth federal execution this year, and the second this week, after the practice was resumed by US President Donald Trump's administration.,Under Trump, the Justice Department has now executed twice as many men this year than all of Trump’s predecessors combined going back to 1963. The last time the US government executed six or more people in a single year was in 1942, according to the Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC) in Washington.,The execution of Vialva, 40, comes as the nation grapples with racial disparities in the criminal justice system, with daily protests occurring against police brutality against Black people.,Of the 56 people on federal death row, 26, or 46 per cent are Black, and 22, or 39 per cent, are white. Black people are only 13 per cent of the US population.,DPIC published a report this month concluding that racial bias persists in the US system of capital punishment in which the killers of white people were more likely to face the death penalty than the killers of Black people.,At Vialva’s trial in 2000, a jury of 11 white people and one Black person found him and a Black accomplice, Brandon Bernard, guilty of carjacking and murder. Bernard’s execution date has not been set.,According to court records, Vialva and his accomplices were looking for someone to rob when they found Todd Bagley using a payphone at a store and he agreed to give them a ride in his car. In the back seat, Vialva pulled out a gun and ordered Bagley and his wife to get into the car’s trunk.,After forcing Bagley to disclose his PIN, Vialva withdrew cash from Bagley’s account at an ATM, though there was less than $100 on deposit. He bought some fast food and cigarettes. During the several hours they spent in the trunk, the Bagleys could be heard telling their kidnappers to embrace Christianity.,Eventually, Vialva parked the car in an isolated part of Fort Hood, opened the trunk and shot both Bagleys in the head, killing Todd and rendering Stacie unconscious. Bernard then set the car on fire and an autopsy showed that Stacie Bagley died from smoke inhalation.,Todd Bagley’s mother, Georgia, welcomed the execution in a statement shared by the Bureau of Prisons, saying it should have happened within three to five years of the crime, not 21.,“They were willing to lay down their lives to try and win their kidnappers to the Lord by quoting scripture, praying, and singing praises to God before they died,” her statement said.,“We’ll never know how many people they could have influenced for good if they had been given the chance,” Georgia added.

"Facebook Inc on Thursday said it had dismantled three networks of fake accounts which could be used by Russia's intelligence services to leak hacked documents as part of efforts to disrupt the upcoming U.S. election.,The company said the accounts, which it suspended for using fake identities and other types of ""coordinated inauthentic behaviour"", were linked to Russian intelligence and people associated with a St. Petersburg-based organisation accused by U.S. officials of working to sway the 2016 presidential vote.,The Russian foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Moscow has repeatedly denied allegations of election meddling and says it does not interfere in the domestic politics of other countries.,Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, said there was no immediate evidence that hacked documents were about to be leaked, but by suspending the accounts Facebook hoped to prevent them being used in any subsequent operation.,""Our team watches for the threats and trends that we need to be ready for and one that we are very aware of ... is a hack-and-leak operation, particularly in the next 6-8 weeks,"" he told Reuters.,""We want to make sure that the accounts are down to prevent their ability to pivot them to facilitate a hack-and-leak around the U.S. election."",Facebook said the networks were small with only a handful of accounts on its website and photo-sharing service Instagram, and a combined total of around 97,000 followers.,Twitter said it had worked with Facebook to identify and remove 350 accounts that were operated by state-linked organisations in Russia.,Both companies said one of the networks had been identified following a tip from the FBI, which warned on Tuesday that foreign actors and cybercriminals were likely to spread disinformation about the results of November's election.,The warnings follow an alert by Microsoft earlier this month that hackers linked to Russia, China, and Iran are trying to spy on people tied to both U.S. President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden.,Graham Brookie, director of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, worked with Facebook to analyse the suspended accounts.

"Brussels, September 25,European governments will pay claims above an agreed limit against AstraZeneca over side-effects from its potential COVID-19 vaccine, under different terms to a deal struck with Sanofi, an EU official told Reuters.,The deals reflect different strategies by two of the world’s top drugmakers for protecting themselves as a debate rages about liabilities for vaccines aimed at ending the pandemic.,AstraZeneca has secured the European Union’s backing in a confidential agreement which reflected the lower price sought by the British drugmaker, the official said.,“If a company asks for a higher price, we don’t give the same conditions,” said the official, who was involved in the talks but declined to be identified as the contracts are confidential.,Unexpected side-effects after a drug has regulatory approval are rare, but the speed at which a COVID-19 vaccine is being pursued increases the risks of unforeseen conditions.,The deal with AstraZeneca, which shifts some of the risks involved in the roll-out of a vaccine to taxpayers, was struck in August and its liability clauses have not previously been reported.,Under the deal, AstraZeneca would only pay legal costs up to a certain threshold, the official said, declining to elaborate on how the costs would be shared with individual European governments or the cap.,The financial shield would cover both legal costs and potential compensation, which is rarer but potentially a much bigger outlay in the event of something going wrong. In return for the higher price paid for its vaccine, French drugmaker Sanofi, which is working with GlaxoSmithKline as a partner, did not get any liability waiver.,Spokespeople for AstraZeneca, Sanofi and the European Commission declined to comment on the specifics of the deals.,When asked about AstraZeneca’s relatively low price, a spokesman reiterated the company’s pledge to share the vaccine widely and not to turn a profit from it during the pandemic.,Under the AstraZeneca deal, EU countries have agreed to pay 2.5 euros ($2.92) per dose, while Sanofi has negotiated a price at around 10 euros, the official said.,As part of the supply deals, the only two sealed so far by Brussels, the EU has also made a non-refundable downpayment of 336 million euros to AstraZeneca to secure 400 million doses, proportionately lower than the 324 million euros it paid to Sanofi to secure 300 million doses.,The EU official told Reuters that the contract with AstraZeneca included a narrow definition of side-effects that could limit the possibility of claiming compensation although the company remains liable for its vaccine.,The deal with AstraZeneca was negotiated before it paused late-stage trials of its vaccine candidate this month after a British volunteer developed neurological symptoms. Trials have resumed in Britain but not in the United States.,EU governments would share compensation costs only if unexpected side-effects emerged after the AstraZeneca vaccine was approved.,Liability has been a key stumbling block in talks with other COVID-19 vaccine makers, EU officials have said, as companies fear they risk larger legal costs than they usually face when vaccines are developed in much longer trials.,A European Commission spokesman said advance purchase deals “provide for member states to indemnify the manufacturer for certain liabilities incurred under specific and strict conditions” but “liability still remains with the companies”.,This means it would be the firm’s responsibility to defend its shot in the courts.,Drugmakers have called on EU regulators to set up a Europe-wide compensation scheme, while patients’ organisations are calling for an EU-wide fund financed by pharmaceutical firms that would compensate for unexpected side-effects.,The EU legal regime is among the least favourable to drugmakers on compensation claims, although plaintiffs have rarely managed to win as the law requires them to prove the link between an illness and a vaccine that may have caused it.,The United States has granted immunity from liability for COVID-19 vaccines that receive regulatory approval.,Meanwhile, Russia has said it would shoulder some of the legal liability should anything go wrong with the vaccine developed by Moscow’s Gamaleya Institute.

"Dubai, September 25,The party was going strong: traditional music blared, families cheered, throngs of revellers danced. Then, the police burst in. Officers kicked out guests, slapped hefty fines — even locked up the tuxedoed groom and singers.,In recent weeks, such unhappy endings to long-awaited weddings have become a common story in the Arab world as resurgent coronavirus caseloads trigger tough police action.,Still, in a region where marriage is the cornerstone of society — the gateway to independence and the only culturally acceptable context for a sex life — couples are plowing ahead, despite the deadly risks.,From the Palestinian territories to the United Arab Emirates, officials attribute a spike in virus cases to traditional, large-scale weddings that flout public health measures.,In Jenin, in the northern West Bank, Mustafa Khatib and six of his band members spent two nights in jail for serenading a crowded wedding party this month. Police fined the group $11,000.,“This is not fair,” said Khatib, “People will never stop getting married and will never stop holding parties.”,Mohammed Abu al-Naji, another singer, was released from detention only after pledging to stop singing until the pandemic ends.,“There were some 500 people at the party, with no protection whatsoever,” al-Naji recalled. “I wasn’t happy to be at such a wedding but I had to, to make ends meet,” he said.,Palestinian authorities have shut down dozens of ceremonies, said police spokesman Loaie Irzekat.,Yet the wave of fines, detentions and infections hasn’t stopped determined couples from getting hitched — surrounded by hundreds of their friends.,“You plan to have a small wedding but then all your relatives and friends show up,” explained Qasim Najjar, whose wedding party last weekend in the northern West Bank village of Deir Sharaf was dispersed by police.,“This is our custom.”,For Arab families, large and lavish weddings mark social status. For newlyweds, the custom of accepting cash-filled envelopes helps them set up homes. For Palestinians, the ritual may run even deeper.,“It’s an existential thing,” said Randa Serhan, a political sociologist at the American University of Beirut, referring to Palestinians living under Israeli occupation or in exile.,“If Palestinians stop marrying and procreating, they’ll cease to exist. They don’t have a nation but they have family,” Serhan added.,The celebrations of life carry potentially fatal consequences. Palestinian Health Ministry official Ali Abed Rabu linked over 80 per cent of new coronavirus infections to large gatherings at weddings and funerals.,Indoor wedding halls in conservative towns like Hebron have become vectors of contagion, he said. Coronavirus cases are now surging to new heights. The Palestinian Authority has reported over 34,500 cases in the West Bank and 270 deaths.,In Israel, which is grappling with one of the world’s worst coronavirus outbreaks on a per capita basis, authorities point to large weddings in Arab towns as a leading cause of the spread of the virus.,Along with ultra-Orthodox enclaves, known for large weddings and group prayers, Arab communities are among the hardest hit by the virus.,Arab-Israeli lawmaker Ahmad Tibi told The Associated Press that the infection rate in Arab areas had soared from roughly three per cent to 30 per cent during the summer wedding season.,Israeli citizens, disillusioned after a failed first lockdown, are starting to “disregard government instructions”, he added.,When Egypt’s wedding halls shut down this spring as infections swelled, the wealthy moved their extravagant celebrations to private villas. Working-class Egyptians took their raucous parties to village streets, prompting local police to break up the festivities. But restrictions have relaxed as virus cases waned.,Although Egyptian officials still warn of a possible “second wave”, the government announced last week that weddings could resume outdoors and in certified hotels.,In the UAE, daily infection rates reached a four-month peak, prompting a top health official to scold the public for “complacency and negligence”.,Dr Farida al-Hosani, a Health Ministry spokeswoman, said close to 90 per cent of new cases stemmed from crowds at weddings, funerals and other events.,The Emirati government has intensified its crackdown on illicit bashes. Last weekend, authorities ordered the detention of eight people across the country who had thrown massive, maskless parties.,They remain in custody, facing prison terms of up to six months and minimum fines of $27,226 each.,In the capital of Abu Dhabi, a groom, his father and father-in-law face prosecution after police broke up their tent wedding and issued $2,700 fines to the guests.,The sleepy northernmost emirate of Ras al-Khaimah has never been a match for Dubai, the glittering city-state known for it is Champagne-soaked nightclubs.,Yet the coronavirus has transformed the dusty town into a freewheeling party haven.

"Louisville (Kentucky), September 23,The second night of anti-racism protests got off to a tense but mostly peaceful start in Louisville, Kentucky, on Thursday, a day after a grand jury decided not to bring homicide charges against police officers involved in the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor.,As a curfew went into effect after dark and police declared an unlawful assembly, a group of 200 to 300 protesters who had marched through the city for hours retreated to the grounds of the First Unitarian Church, set aside by organizers as a sanctuary near the Ohio River waterfront.,Some of the marchers had smashed windows of several local businesses, and even a hospital, along the way, according to a Reuters journalist. But the scene outside the church contrasted sharply with violence that flared the previous night in Kentucky’s largest city.,“At least 24 people were arrested throughout the evening for charges including unlawful assembly, failure to disperse and riot in the first degree,” the Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) said in a statement.,Angry demonstrations and sporadic clashes between police and protesters in the hours following the grand jury announcement turned bloody late on Wednesday when two police officers on crowd-control duty were shot and wounded.,A suspect was arrested a short time later, and Louisville police chief Robert Schroeder said on Thursday that the two wounded officers were expected to recover.,Schroeder, his department reinforced by state police and Kentucky National Guard troops, said he expected protests to continue for days, and a night-time curfew was extended through the weekend.,“For all of us it is a very tense and emotional time,” Schroeder told a news conference on Thursday. Police said 127 arrests were made in the first night of protests, most for curfew violations or disobeying orders to disperse.,The protests began on Wednesday after the grand jury decided that none of the three white officers who collectively fired 32 gunshots as they stormed Breonna Taylor’s apartment would be charged with causing her death.,One of the officers was indicted on charges of endangering Taylor’s neighbours with several stray bullets he fired into an adjacent apartment during the March 13 raid, carried out as part of a narcotics investigation.

Walker exchanged gunfire with the police.,The grand jury decision, announced by Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, was immediately denounced by civil rights advocates as the latest miscarriage of justice in a US law enforcement system corrupted by racial inequity.,Cameron said there was “no conclusive” evidence that any of the 10 shots fired by former Detective Brett Hankison, the officer indicted on wanton endangerment charges, ever struck Taylor.,His two colleagues, Sergeant Jonathan Mattingly and Detective Myles Cosgrove, used justified force under Kentucky law because they were returning fire — a combined total of 22 rounds — after Walker shot at them first, wounding Mattingly in the thigh, according to Cameron.,Walker has said he fired a warning shot because he feared a criminal intrusion and did not hear police identify themselves.,Wednesday’s protests turned violent around nightfall as police in riot gear ordered demonstrators to clear the streets after several fires were set in trash cans near a downtown park and outside the city’s Hall of Justice.,A Reuters journalist heard several gunshots ring out, and members of the crowd scurried for cover. An arrest report said the accused gunman, Larynzo Johnson, 26, was seen on video opening fire on police with a handgun.,Johnson was charged with two counts of assault in the first degree and 14 counts of wanton endangerment. His first court hearing was set for Friday.,Police said several businesses were vandalized or looted during the night, but the demonstrations were otherwise mostly peaceful.,Protests also flared on Wednesday in New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Washington, Oakland, Philadelphia, Denver and Portland, Oregon, Seattle and Buffalo, New York.,Taylor’s slaying initially drew little national attention.,But it was thrust into prominence after George Floyd, a Black man arrested for a non-violent offence in Minneapolis, died under the knee of a white police officer on May 25, igniting a summer of protests against racial injustice and excessive police force.,Hankison was fired in June, while Mattingly and Cosgrove were reassigned to administrative duties.,Louisville has agreed to pay $12 million to Taylor’s family to settle a wrongful-death lawsuit.,In addition to largely orderly activists, the demonstrations have drawn a volatile mix of armed, right-wing militias and anarchists.,On Thursday evening in Louisville, a throng of protesters was seen by a Reuters journalist confronting a group of about 15 armed individuals dressed in military-style gear who identified themselves as members of the Oath Keepers, an organization associated with the militia movement.,The standoff was diffused when protest organizer persuaded demonstrators in their group to leave peacefully.

"Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), a globally-banned terror group, is now probably capable of only “small-scale regional attacks”, a top American counter-terrorism official has told lawmakers.,AQIS was set up by al-Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri in 2014 to expand the terror group’s influence in the region.,“In South Asia, al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) has struggled to rebound from the death of its leader, Asim Umar, in a US military raid in Afghanistan in September 2019, and is probably only capable of small-scale regional attacks,” Christopher Miller, Director, National Counter-Terrorism Center, told a Senate committee on Thursday.,Testifying before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on the “Threats to the Homeland”, the top American counter-terrorism official said that in mid-March, the AQIS published a special issue of Nawai Afghan Jihad praising the US-Taliban agreement, which mirrored al-Qaeda’s leaders’ statements on the deal.,“Finally, Al-Qaeda’s presence in Afghanistan has been reduced to a few dozen fighters who are primarily focused on their survival and are probably incapable of conducting attacks outside the country under sustained CT pressure,” Miller said.,According to Miller, since the Global War on Terror began nearly two decades ago, the US has significantly degraded terrorist adversaries and made the US a considerably harder target for them to reach.,“Today’s terrorism threat to the US and our allies is less acute but more diffuse — emanating from more groups in more places than it did in 2001,” he said.,“While continued counter-terrorism pressure has degraded the group’s Afghanistan-Pakistan senior leadership, in the near term, the Al-Qaeda is more likely to focus on building its international affiliates and supporting small-scale, readily achievable attacks in key regions such as East and West Africa,” said FBI Director Christopher Wray.,“Simultaneously, over the last year, propaganda from al-Qaeda leaders seeks to inspire individuals to conduct their own attacks in the US and the West. For example, the December 2019 attack at Naval Air Station Pensacola demonstrates that groups such as al-Qaeda continue to be interested in encouraging attacks on the US soil,” he said.,Miller told senators that 19 years ago, after the shock of Al Qaeda’s devastating attacks abated, the US set out to accomplish three objectives; one, harden its borders; two, go overseas to destroy the safe havens and sanctuaries of al-Qaeda and its associated groups and attrit their combat forces; and three, address the drivers of instability that created al-Qaeda by supporting like-minded partners in their efforts to combat Islamist extremism.,“Due to the enormous dedication, selfless service and sacrifice of hundreds of thousands of Americans and like-minded foreign partners, we have been remarkably successful in accomplishing the first two objectives. I sense that we are on the verge, if providence is kind, of transitioning from a US-led, partner-enable campaign to an era where local and regional partners take the lead and we provide them niche support to fill gaps in their security, intelligence, informational and legal architectures,” he said.,“I must be clear and not histrionic. Our enemies will successfully attack us again, as their adaptation and innovation are driven by a profound hatred for what we represent. This is our terrorists' dilemma and their strategic advantage. They only need to be successful once while our defences must be successful all the time for preventing a cataclysmic attack. But our enemies have profoundly underestimated the resilience of the American people time and again,” Miller said.,Miller wondered if the 9/11 Al-Qaeda leaders regretted their decision to attack the US.,“I’m confident the survivors must. They thought us soft and spoiled and morally unanchored. They are now either dead, imprisoned or in hiding awaiting death or capture. Their ideology is debunked in the overwhelming majority of this Islamic world. No one today misjudges our resolve and commitment to protecting the security of our citizens and using all available instruments of national power against those that bring war and violence to our shores,” he added.

"Washington, September 25,The Trump administration on Thursday proposed a fixed time limit on visas of students, researchers and foreign journalists in the United States, noting that it was concerned about the liberal existing visa programme being abused and a potential for increased risk to national security.,The proposal scheduled to be notified in the Federal Register on Friday is not country-specific but has been brought in view of the abuse of the existing loopholes in the system by China. In all three categories of foreign students, researchers and journalists, those from China have benefitted the most.,Under the proposed rule, ‘F’ (students visa) or ‘J’ (researchers visa) non-immigrants would be admitted into the US for a period up to the end date of their programme, not to exceed four years.,Foreign nationals from countries associated with high visa overstay rates (rates greater than 10 per cent for student and exchange visitors) will be limited to up to a two-year fixed period of stay to increase monitoring, deter immigration violations and incentivise a timely departure, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said.,“Amending the relevant regulations is critical in improving the programme oversight mechanisms, preventing foreign adversaries from exploiting the country’s education environment and properly enforcing and strengthening the US immigration laws,” Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli said.,The duration of stay can be reduced to a maximum of two years of authorised stay in the US if the foreign national is either born or has the citizenship of a country that is on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list.,Separately, the DHS has proposed initially admitting most ‘I’ non-immigrants for a period of time necessary to complete the planned activities or assignments consistent with the ‘I’ classification, not to exceed 240 days. They can be given another extension for a maximum of 240 days, based on the length of the relevant activities. As of now, foreign journalists on ‘I’ visas have remained in the US for many a time for decades.,Foreign students would now get just 30 days, instead of the existing 60 days, to leave the country, the DHS said. The stakeholders have been given 30 days’ time to respond to the notification.,In 2019 alone, there were over 10 lakh admissions in the ‘F’ status, a dramatic rise from the 263,938 admissions in the ‘F’ status when the legacy Immigration and Naturalisation Service (INS) shifted to an unspecified duration of status or D/S admission in 1978.,Similar growth in the ‘J’ population has also occurred over the past decades. In 2018, there were 611,373 admissions in the ‘J’ status, up by over 300 per cent from the 1,41,213 ‘J’ admissions into the US in 1985.,Finally, there were 44,140 admissions for foreign media representatives in the US in 2018, a growth of over 160 per cent from the 16,753 admissions into the country in 1985.,Studying and participating in exchange visitor and academic programmes in the US offered foreign nationals access to world-renowned faculty, cutting-edge resources, state-of-the-art courses and individualised instructional programmes, the federal notification said.,Similarly, the US fosters an environment that promotes the exchange of ideas and encourages open discussions when there are differences of opinions, which the country also encourages by allowing foreign news and media members the same unimpeded access and opportunity to share in the constitutional freedoms of the press as domestic news and media members.,However, the DHS said the significant increase in the volume of ‘F’ academic students, ‘J’ exchange visitors and ‘I’ foreign information media representatives pose a challenge to its ability to monitor and oversee these categories of non-immigrants while they are in the US.,During the length of their stay for D/S, a period of admission without a specified end date, these non-immigrants are not required to have direct interaction with the DHS except for a few limited instances such as when applying for employment authorisation for optional practical training or for reinstatement if they have failed to maintain the status.,An admission for D/S, in general, does not afford immigration officers enough predetermined opportunities to directly verify that the aliens granted such non-immigrant statuses are engaging only in those activities that their respective classifications authorise while they are in the US. In turn, this has undermined the DHS’s ability to effectively enforce compliance with the statutory inadmissibility grounds related to unlawful presence and created incentives for fraud and abuse.,The DHS said it anticipated that many ‘F’, ‘J’ and ‘I’ non-immigrants would be able to complete their activities within their periods of admission. However, those who could not generally, would be able to request an extension to their period of admission to an immigration officer.,In addition, as proposed, certain categories of foreign nationals would be eligible for shorter periods of admission, based on national security, fraud or overstay concerns, but like all foreigners with fixed admission periods, would have a specific date upon which they would be required to depart the US or would need to apply to the DHS to have their continued eligibility for the ‘F’, ‘J’ or ‘I’ status reviewed by immigration officers.,The DHS believes that this process would help mitigate the risks posed by foreign adversaries who seek to exploit these programmes, said the notification running into 256 pages. Replacing admissions for D/S with admissions for a fixed period of authorised stay is consistent with most other non-immigrant categories, it added.,The notification said the D/S framework, because it reduces opportunities for a direct vetting of foreign academic students by immigration officers, creates opportunities for foreign adversaries to exploit the F-1 programme and undermine US national security.,An open education environment in the US offers enormous benefits, but it also places research universities and the nation at the risk of economic, academic or military espionage by foreign students.,“Foreign adversaries are using progressively sophisticated and resourceful methods to exploit the US educational environment, including well-documented cases of espionage through the student program,” it said.,Detecting and deterring emerging threats to US national security posed by adversaries exploiting the F-1 programme requires additional oversight, the notification asserted. Same is the case with research scholars under ‘J’ visas as well, it said. PTI","Sep 25, 2020

"Rome, September 25,The powerful head of the Vatican’s saint-making office, Cardinal Angelo Becciu, resigned suddenly Thursday from the post and renounced his rights as a cardinal amid a financial scandal that has reportedly implicated him indirectly.,The Vatican provided no details on why Pope Francis accepted Becciu’s resignation in a statement late Thursday. In the one-sentence announcement, the Holy See said only that Francis had accepted Becciu’s resignation as prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints “and his rights connected to the cardinalate”.,Becciu, the former no. 2 in the Vatican’s secretariat of state, has been reportedly implicated in a financial scandal involving the Vatican’s investment in a London real estate deal that has lost the Holy See millions of euros in fees paid to middlemen.,The Vatican prosecutor has placed several Vatican officials under investigation, as well as the middlemen, but not Becciu.,Becciu has defended the soundness of the original investment and denied any wrongdoing and it’s not clear whether the scandal itself was behind his resignation or possibly sparked a separate line of inquiry.,But the late-breaking news of his resignation, the severity of his apparent sanction, the Vatican’s tight-lipped release and the unexpected downfall of one of the most powerful Vatican officials all suggested a shocking new chapter in the scandal, which has convulsed the Vatican for the past year.,The last time a cardinal’s rights were removed was when American Theodore McCarrick renounced his rights and privileges as a cardinal in July 2018 amid a sexual abuse investigation. He was subsequently defrocked altogether by Francis last year for sexually abusing adults as well as minors.,Before him, the late Scottish Cardinal Keith O’Brien in 2015 relinquished the rights and privileges of being a cardinal after unidentified priests alleged sexual misconduct.,O’Brien was, however, allowed to retain the cardinal’s title and he died a member of the College of Cardinals, the elite group of churchmen whose main job is to elect a pope.,In the Vatican statement, the Holy See identified Becciu as “His Eminence Cardinal Angelo Becciu,” making clear he remained a cardinal but without any rights.,At 72, Becciu would have been able to participate in a possible future conclave to elect Francis’ successor. Cardinals over age 80 can’t vote. But by renouncing his rights as a cardinal, Becciu has relinquished his rights to take part.,Becciu was the “substitute”, or top deputy in the secretariat of state from 2011 to 2018, when Francis made him a cardinal and moved him into the Vatican’s saint-making office.,He straddled two pontificates, having been named by Pope Benedict XVI and entrusted with essentially running the Curia, or Vatican bureaucracy, a position that gave him enormous influence and power.,The financial problems date from 2014 when the Vatican entered into a real estate venture by investing over $200 million in a fund run by an Italian businessman. The deal gave the Holy See 45 per cent of the luxury building at 60 Sloane Avenue in London’s Chelsea neighbourhood.,The money came from the secretariat of state’s asset portfolio, which is funded in large part by the Peter’s Pence donations of Catholics around the world for the pope to use for charity and Vatican expenses.,The Holy See decided in November 2018, after Becciu had left the secretariat of state, to exit the fund, end its relationship with the businessman and buy out the remainder of the building.,It did so after Becciu’s successor determined that the mortgage was too onerous and that the businessman was losing money for the Vatican in some of the fund’s other investments.,The buyout deal, however, cost the Holy See tens of millions of euros more and sparked the Vatican investigation that has so far implicated a half-dozen Vatican employees.,Becciu has insisted he wasn’t in power during the 2018 buyout deal and always acted in the sole interests of the Holy See. In the Vatican prosecutor’s initial warrant, Becciu is not named and it remains unclear if his role in managing the secretariat of state’s vast asset portfolio was connected with the resignation.,His former boss, Secretary of State Pietro Parolin, has said the whole matter is “opaque” and needs to be clarified.,Francis, for his part, has vowed to get to the bottom of what he has said was evidence of corruption in the Holy See.,Francis would meet regularly with Becciu in the Italian’s role as prefect of the saint-making office, since every month or two he would present lists of candidates for possible beatification or canonization for Francis to approve.,In addition, since the beginning of his pontificate, Francis had an annual luncheon date at Becciu’s apartment along with 10 priests on the Thursday of Holy Week leading up to Easter. The Vatican always reported the get-togethers were a chance for the pope to chat informally with Becciu and priests of his diocese on the day the church celebrates the institution of the priesthood.,The luncheon didn’t happen this year amid the Vatican’s coronavirus lockdown.

"Scientists have identified highly effective antibodies against the novel coronavirus, which they say can lead to the development of a passive vaccination for COVID-19.,Unlike in active vaccination, passive vaccination involves the administration of ready-made antibodies, which are degraded after some time.,However, the effect of a passive vaccination is almost immediate, whereas with an active vaccination it has to build up first, the researchers said.,The research, published in the journal Cell, also shows that some SARS-CoV-2 antibodies bind to tissue samples from various organs, which could potentially trigger undesired side effects.,The scientists at the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) and Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin isolated almost 600 different antibodies from the blood of individuals who had overcome COVID-19, the disease triggered by SARS-CoV-2.,By means of laboratory tests, they were able to narrow this number down to a few antibodies that were particularly effective at binding to the virus.,The researchers then produced these antibodies artificially using cell cultures.,The so-called neutralising antibodies bind to the virus, as crystallographic analysis reveals, and thus prevent the pathogen from entering cells and reproducing, they said.,In addition, virus recognition by antibodies helps immune cells to eliminate the pathogen. Studies in hamsters—which, like humans, are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2—confirmed the high efficacy of the selected antibodies.,“If the antibodies were given after an infection, the hamsters developed mild disease symptoms at most. If the antibodies were applied preventively—before infection—the animals did not get sick,” said Jakob Kreye, coordinator of the research project.,The researchers noted that treating infectious diseases with antibodies has a long history.,For COVID-19, this approach is also being investigated through the administration of plasma derived from the blood of recovered patients. With the plasma, antibodies of donors are transferred, they said.,""Ideally, the most effective antibody is produced in a controlled manner on an industrial scale and in constant quality. This is the goal we are pursuing,"" said Momsen Reincke, first author of the research.,“Three of our antibodies are particularly promising for clinical development,” explained Harald Pruss, a research group leader at the DZNE and also a senior physician at Charite – Universitatsmedizin Berlin.,""Using these antibodies, we have started to develop a passive vaccination against SARS-CoV-2,"" Pruss said.,In addition to the treatment of patients, preventive protection of healthy individuals who have had contact with infected persons is also a potential application, the researchers said.,How long the protection lasts will have to be investigated in clinical studies, they said.,“This is because, unlike in active vaccination, passive vaccination involves the administration of ready-made antibodies, which are degraded after some time,” Pruss said. In general, the protection provided by a passive vaccination is less persistent than that provided by an active vaccination, the researchers said.,However, the effect of a passive vaccination is almost immediate, whereas with an active vaccination it has to build up first, they said.,“It would be best if both options were available so that a flexible response could be made depending on the situation,” Pruss added.

The plan had triggered protests even within Japan's governing party because of China's tightening of controls over Hong Kong and its assertive actions in regional seas.,“We did not discuss (Xi's) possible visit to Japan,” Suga said.,However, the leaders agreed to hold summits and other high-level meetings to cooperate in bilateral, regional and international issues, he said.,Relations between the two Asian rivals have improved recently as China faces heightened tensions with the United States.,But Japan sees China's military development and increasingly assertive stance in the East and South China Seas as a major security threat.

"Pope Francis urged world leaders on Friday to use the coronavirus emergency as an opportunity to reform the injustices of the global economy and the “perverse logic” of the nuclear deterrence doctrine, warning that increased isolationist responses to problems “must not prevail”.,Francis laid out his appeal for greater involvement and influence of the United Nations in protecting the poor, migrants and the environment in a videotaped speech Friday to the UN General Assembly, held mostly virtually this year because of the pandemic.,Francis said the world has a choice to make as it emerges from the COVID-19 crisis and addresses the grave economic impact it has had on the planet’s most vulnerable: greater solidarity, dialogue and multilateralism, or self-retreat into greater nationalism, individualism and elitism.,The latter, he said, “would certainly be detrimental to the whole community, causing self-inflicted wounds on everyone. It must not prevail”. Ever since the virus struck Italy in late February, Francis has sought to show the interconnectedness of the pandemic with the health of the planet and its people.,His message is that the crisis provides a chance “to come out better or worse,” and that there are plenty of reasons to work to come out better.,“The pandemic has shown us that we cannot live without one another, or worse still, pitted against one another,” he said. “This is why, at this critical juncture, it is our duty to rethink the future of our common home and our common project.”                   ,Francis is expected to lay out further his vision for solidarity and the post-COVID world in an encyclical to be released October 4. In a way, his UN speech was something of an executive summary or blueprint for what is expected, a brief overview of his core concerns of economic justice, environmental protection and care for society’s most marginal.,Francis reaffirmed the Catholic Church’s opposition to abortion — one of the Vatican’s key ideological points of contention with the United Nations. He said recourse to abortion had only increased in the pandemic, saying it was “sad” that some countries were promoting abortion as an essential service to be provided even during the health emergency.,“It is troubling to see how simple and convenient it has become for some to deny the existence of a human life as a solution to problems that can and must be solved for both the mother and her unborn child,” he said.,Francis called for basic health care for all, the reduction, if not forgiveness of debt for the world’s poorest countries and a reform of the Bretton-Woods financial institutions which he said are only escalating inequalities between rich and poor.,“Now is a fitting time to renew the architecture of international finance,” he said.,He repeated his demand for an end to the doctrine of nuclear deterrence, which he articulated most fully during his 2019 visit to Japan at the memorial dedicated to victims of the atomic bombing in Hiroshima.,“We need to dismantle the perverse logic that links personal and national security to the possession of weaponry,” he said. “Nuclear deterrence, in particular, creates an ethos of fear based on the threat of mutual annihilation; in this way, it ends up poisoning relationships between peoples and obstructing dialogue.” AP","Sep 25, 2020

Trump has also pulled the US out of the WHO.,In his address to the UN General Assembly on September 23, Trump also attacked the WHO, saying it is “virtually controlled by China”.,Last week, Yang Xiaoming, Chairman of China National Biotec Group, which had obtained approval to start the phase 3 trials for its coronavirus vaccine candidates in the UAE, said 350,000 people had been injected with the experimental vaccines under the scheme.,Yang Sheng, Deputy director of the National Medical Products Administration’s drug registration bureau, said that four China-developed COVID-19 vaccines have begun the final stage of human trials overseas after obtaining approval from the foreign authorities.,China has been focusing on developing five types of vaccines and each method has at least one entering clinical trials. In total, 11 vaccine candidates are in different stages of testing, Yang was quoted as saying by state-run China Daily.,Zheng said China’s annual capacity to make COVID-19 vaccines was expected to reach 610 million doses this year and 1 billion doses by 2021.
