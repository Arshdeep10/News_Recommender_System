We have had a good game (against Sunrisers Hyderabad), we have had a bad game and now it is time to move on and learn from the mistakes we made,” said Kohli.,On sending the young Josh Philippe ahead of himself at number 3, Kohli said: “He has batted at the top of the order for Western Australia and done well in the BBL as well, early days in the tournament so we thought we will maximise his ability and see how we go from there on. We thought we will give ourselves a bit of depth in the middle overs.”,The Australian wicketkeeper-batsman had batted in the middle-order in RCB’s first game against Sunrisers.,RCB next play defending champions Mumbai Indians here on September 28.

"Dubai, September 24,Skipper K L Rahul's sublime hundred was the highlight of an all-round performance as Kings XI Punjab defeated Royal Challengers Bangalore by a whopping 97-run margin here on Thursday.,Opening the innings, Rahul punished the RCB bowlers into submission to help KXIP to a daunting 206 for three before the bowling attack put up a disciplined effort to bundle Virat Kohli's side for 109 with three overs to spare.,The KXIP skipper, who was dropped by Kohli late in the innings, scored an unbeaten 132 off 69 balls that was laced with 14 boundaries and seven sixes.,With his spectacular knock, Rahul surpassed Rishabh Pant (128 in 2018) to post the highest individual score by an Indian and a captain in IPL history.,It was a rather ordinary performance from RCB after the win against Sunrisers Hyderabad in their tournament opener. For KXIP, the win came after a super over loss against Delhi Capitals.,RCB were in all sorts for trouble from the beginning of the run chase with Devdutt Padikkal (1) and Josh Philippe (0) returning back to the dug out in the first two overs.,After dropping two catches, Kohli, undoubtedly one of the best when it comes to run-chasing, failed with the bat managing just a run off five balls before he was caught off a Sheldon Cottrell delivery.,Opener Aaron Finch (20) was then joined in the middle by AB de Villiers (28). The duo looked dangerous, milking deliveries wherever possible. The two added 49-runs before the young Ravi Bishnoi broke the stand by getting rid of the Australian limited overs captain. Bishnoi (3/32) and Murugan Ashwin (3/21) dismissed Finch and de Villiers in quick succession with RCB reeling at 57 for five. Washington Sundar was the top scorer for RCB, hitting 30 off 27 deliveries.,Ashwin was the pick of the bowlers for KXIP, he picked three wickets giving away 21 runs. Bishnoi too claimed three wickets and was impressive once again. Cottrell (2/17), Mohammad Shami (1/14) and Glenn Maxwell (1/10) too bowled economical spells.,Earlier, Rahul also became the fastest Indian to reach 2000 IPL runs, reaching the milestone in his 60th innings. The stylish batsman clipped away a full length delivery to fine leg for four to break Sachin Tendulkar's record, who reached the milestone in 63 matches.,Opening the batting with Rahul, Mayank Agarwal (26) looked dangerous and shared a 57-run stand with his captain. However, with the introduction of spin into the attack in the seventh over, Yuzvendra Chahal (1/25) struck with the last ball, cleaning up Agarwal (26) with a delightful googly.,Nicholas Pooran (17) and Glenn Maxwell (5) once again failed to make an impact as Shivam Dube (2/33) accounted for the duo. Karun Nair pitched in with an eight-ball 15.,The pace troika of Umesh Yadav (0/35), Dale Steyn (0/57) and Navdeep Saini (0/37) had a torrid time as the KXIP skipper was on fire in his second game as captain.

He asked me not to try too many things and try to be cool and calm in the middle,” Bishnoi said at the post-match press conference.,The India U-19 World Cup player returned impressive figures of 3-32 in his four overs against a side that boasts of the likes of Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers.,When asked, he sounded confident about bowling against the top players.,“Since we had a long camp before the IPL, I was preparing myself mentally as skill level is the same for everyone here. So being mentally strong and brave was my main focus. I told myself not to bowl lose deliveries which would allow them to attack me,” said the leg-spinner.,“We prepared well in our camp before the tournament here. We were focusing on mental strength and not bowling lose balls,” he added.,Skipper KL Rahul’s sublime hundred was the highlight of an all-round performance as Kings XI Punjab crushed Royal Challengers Bangalore by a whopping 97-run margin.,Opening the innings, Rahul punished the RCB bowlers into submission to help KXIP to a daunting 206 for three before the bowling attack put up a disciplined effort to bundle Virat Kohli’s side for 109 with three overs to spare.,Speaking about the game, Bishnoi said: “We were targeting to bundle them as early as we can. We stepped on the filed as we have to defend 180 runs,” Bishnoi said.,Regarding his skipper, Bishnoi was full of praise. “He is a class batsman with strong batting technicality. Everybody wants to see his shots again and again,” he said.,Kohli dropped two catches off the blade of Rahul, which proved costly, and his teammate Yuzvendra Chahal said spotting the ball even during practice was a bit difficult. “It was a little bit difficult, even during the practice. It was a little bit hard compared to the other grounds.”,On the current scenario, Chahal said: “It is just the second match and in the first match, we won because of the death bowling. So, it is too early. We bowled well but KL batted so well.” PTI","Sep 25, 2020

I had a chat with Maxi (Glenn Maxwell) yesterday, he asked me how I was feeling, I said I was not feeling completely in control of my batting and he said you must be joking, you are hitting really well,” Rahul said at the post-match presentation.,He had already spoken about his fears leading up to the IPL, considering he was coming back after a five-month-long break due to the COVID-19 pandemic.,“Quite honestly, I was nervous but I knew if I spend time in the middle, hit a few balls from the middle of the bat, it will all settle down. I try to do (the same routine as I did when I was a player) but as a captain, you have shortened time and you are running around and doing a lot of things,” Rahul said.,He is captaining in the IPL for the first time.,“I still try to maintain the same routine. Once I am in the middle and during the toss is the only time I feel like a captain and otherwise I try to balance being a player and the captain,” he said.,After Rahul starred with the bat, KXIP bowlers put a disciplined performance to bundle out RCB for 109 in 17 overs.,“It’s as complete a team performance as it can get. We had a few different plans going into this game. We knew RCB have a power-packed batting line up and we had to get 2-3 wickets up front and that also meant putting runs on the board, we know what these guys can do if they get set. The analyst, coaches and the management will be happy.”,He was all praise for young leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi.,“Something that has impressed me in him (Bishoni’s heart of coming back even after an expensive start). I watched the U-19 World Cup. He has a lot of fight in him. Every time I throw the ball he wants to do well, he was a little nervous bowling at guys like Finchy and AB, once he got through that he did well,” added Rahul. PTI","Sep 25, 2020

"Putting up a stout defence, iconic Sunil Gavaskar on Friday said neither he blamed Virat Kohli’s actor-wife Anushka Sharma for India captain’s failure nor he made any sexist remarks during an IPL match and his comments were being misinterpreted.,Kohli had a bad day in office on Thursday when he led Royal Challengers Bangalore against Kings XI Punjab. He dropped two catches of rival skipper KL Rahul and managed only a run off five balls in RCB’s chase.,While Kohli was still at crease, Gavaskar said India captain is keen to improve and he knows that he can do so only by practicing more and more. He then added that during the lockdown Kohli faced only Anushka’s bowling and it is showing that it did not help much.,Gavaskar was speaking in Hindi when he made the comment.,However, the comment did not go down well with Kohli and Anushka’s fans and some even demanded his sacking from Star Sports commentary panel, lashing out at him on social media.,Reacting to it, Anushka also issued a statement on her Instagram page and said that Gavaskar’s message was “distasteful”.,Gavaskar though said his comments were not understood in right context.,The remark according to Gavaskar was in reference to a video clip where Kohli and Anushka were seen enjoying some tennis ball cricket in their compound.,“Firstly, I would like to say, where am I blaming her, I’m not blaming her. I am only saying that the video showed she was bowling to Virat. Virat has only played that much bowling in this lockdown period,” Gavaskar told India Today channel.,“It is tennis ball fun game that people have to pass time during the lockdown, so that’s all, so where am I blaming her for Virat’s failures.”                 ,Gavaskar also rubbished allegations on social media that he made a “sexist comment”.,“I’m the one who has always batted for wives going with husbands on tours. I am the one who has always said that like a normal guy going to office for a 9-5 job, when he comes back home, he comes back to his wife, similarly why can’t cricketers have their wives with them,” Gavaskar said.,He also tried to explain his comment.,“As you can hear from the commentary, Aakash was talking about the fact there has been very little chance for any proper practice in the lockdown, for everybody...,“.....that has actually shown in rustiness of some of the players in their first matches.

"Dubai, September 26,Chennai Super Kings head coach Stephen Fleming has admitted that his side were “a little bit muddled” at the moment and they need a clearer strategy going ahead after suffering two losses in three matches in the Indian Premier League.,Fleming also rued the missing of some key players that he said has affected the team combination.,“Well, we’re a bit muddled at the moment. We’re missing some key players, and we’re trying to find a balance that allows us to be competitive. We’re looking to develop a personality based on the wickets that we’re facing,” Fleming said after CSK lost to Delhi Capitals by 44 runs on Friday.,“Each wicket has been completely different, and our batting is without Rayudu, (Suresh) Raina etc. We’re trying to find a way or a combination and how to use players. We’ve learned a massive amount over three days,” he added.,Three-time champion CSK could not get going during the run chase against DC, and when asked why Sam Curran or Ravindra Jadeja was not promoted up the batting order, Fleming said they had used the same tactic in the last couple of games.,“We have almost got too many batting options at the moment, so that’s why I say we were a little bit muddled with what we’re sending out, so we just need to be a little bit clearer with what we’re doing, and perhaps what we’re missing is a bigger contribution at the top,” he said.,“It’s a lot of question marks and a lot of soul-searching from coaching point of view and strategy point of view, but we’re trying to find combinations where we get the best players at right times. To keep shunting the order all over the place is not really our style, but we’ve had a go at it and we’ll review how it’s gone.”,Spin bowling has been traditionally CSK’s strength but struggling at the moment, prompting Fleming to say it was an area of concern.,“Yeah, it’s an area of concern, because it’s been such a strength for CSK, and you’ve got to think that the style of play that we’ve developed over the last 12 years is heavily based on spin. So what we’re trying to do is find a different personality.,“Spin still plays a part, and we’ve played on three different grounds, so each game has been different conditions. We’re struggling to adjust to find the pace and the style to bowl through the middle, and that, in the last two games in particular, has been an area where we haven’t done so well. So from a strength to an area of concern, we need to rectify that.”,Asked about the possible team combination in the upcoming matches, Fleming said, “All bets are on the table at the moment as we try to find a way. We are looking forward to playing a number of games here (in Dubai), we were interested in how this pitch played, and get conditions right so we can get right combination.” ,The former New Zealand captain said the dew factor was something that his side couldn’t anticipate.,“We did (consider batting first) but what we can’t anticipate is the dew. We trained across the road the other day and it was soaking wet and it has a huge impact in second innings. Tonight, it was absolutely none so it’s a little bit of hit and miss at the moment,” he said.,“The last game we played in Sharjah was one of the wetter surfaces we’ve been involved in. We’re guessing a little bit around conditions. We are the guinea pigs in terms of playing first games on two venues.”           ,CSK’s next match is against Sunrisers Hyderabad on October 2. — PTI","Sep 26, 2020

They needed one run off the final two balls but Marcus Stoinis’ twin strike took the game to the Super Over, which they lost on Sunday night.,“We had a tough day. There are a lot of positives to take out. The way we came back was fantastic, the way we bowled with the new ball was terrific.

Definitely, we should have finished the game when we needed one run,” he added.,The 29-year-old from Bengaluru said 158 was a decent score to chase.,“It was a par score and going into the break, we knew that if we can stitch a partnership and not give them wickets with the new ball, we could win the game,” he said at the post-match press conference.,“We batted extremely well to reach there.

CSK won their IPL opener against Mumbai Indians by five wickets as Chahar bagged two wickets.,“I think Dhoni prefers those who are good in all departments.

A bowler can have a bad day but he can change a match by grabbing a good catch or can win the batch with a six or a four,” Chahar told former India opener Aakash Chopra in his show ‘Aakash Vaani’.,“If you look at our team, we have many players who are good in every department. T20 is a format that requires you to do everything. There are a lot of teams in the IPL which have a strong batting line-up or a strong bowling attack but they remain dependent on a few cricketers. If they do well, they end up winning you matches single-handedly but if they don’t, the team struggles,” Chahar said.,It was former India captain Dhoni who got Chahar into now-defunct Rising Pune Supergiant in IPL 2016 before also drafting him into three-time winners CSK.,“Generally, you don’t give the old ball to bowlers who have a pace of 120-125 km/h but when I was playing for RPS and even for CSK I was bowling at around 140 but still he didn't give me the ball in the death,” Chahar said, throwing light on his initial journey under Dhoni, regarded as one of the greatest white-ball captains of all time.,“I had asked this to Mahi bhai.

Chahal (3/18) removed the Englishman and Vijay Shankar in successive balls in the 16th over to tilt the game decisively in his team's favour.,Bairstow perished in his attempt to hoick Chahal out of the park while Shankar had no clue about the perfectly placed googly.,That double blow led to a batting collapse, exposing Sunrisers' inexperienced middle-order. Mitchell Marsh suffering an ankle injury while bowling meant he came at number 10 and could only last a ball.,Pacer Navdeep Saini (2/25) and Shivam Dube (2/15) also returned tidy figures but Umesh Yadav was expensive for RCB yet again, leaking 48 runs in four overs.,Earlier, the class and calmness Padikkal showed in his first high-profile game was remarkable, so much so that Australian limited overs captain Aaron Finch (29 off 27) was happy to play second fiddle at the other end.,Sunrisers pulled things back in the middle overs following a 90-run opening stand between Padikkal and Finch. De Villiers came up with crucial boundary hits towards the end to take the team score past 160. The 20-year-old Padikkal, possessing a near perfect balance in the crease, played all around the ground, playing the pull and aerial cover drive with equal confidence. Padikkal got going with three boundaries in an over off left-arm pacer T Natarajan. The left-handed opener brought up his half-century with a slog sweep over the fielder at deep square leg.,With the openers looking good, RCB cruised to 86 for no loss in 10 overs.

I encourage them to keep playing their way and not think too much about the scenario or situation out there.”,“We rely on our senior players to guide these guys out there in the middle, my message to the youngsters was to play their natural game, that’s the only way one can learn. It can be difficult at times, it is a pressure environment, it’s got to keep it calm and simple for them.”,Earlier, Warner was unlucky to be run-out for six when Umesh Yadav managed to get his finger on the ball in his follow-through and it hit the stumps with the SRH skipper short of the crease.,Warner said the fall of wickets changed the momentum of the game.,“It is difficult to play cross-batted shots in the middle overs, you have to play as straight as you can. You have to make the pace. The ball is going up and down but I felt once two batsman gets in it is difficult to try to contain. Obviously, wickets changed the momentum. It was disappointing to not have two batters or one batter in the end,” Warner added.,Asked about the absence of Kane Williamson and Mohammed Nabi, Warner said: “Kane Williamson is not fit, he hurt himself during training the other day and Mohammed Nabi, we thought playing two spinners here given the thought process that we wanted to chase, probably wasn't an option.”,Talking about the fielding errors, Warner said: “It is very different here, playing with high riser light towers and obviously round circle towers, so if the ball goes too high it can be distracting.”,“For Dale Steyn, the ball tailed away from him, it was a very hard ball, at the best of time some people aren't getting there. I think Aaron Finch will be disappointed to drop that absolute sitter (laughs),” he added.,RCB batsman Finch heaped praise on young debutant Devdutt Padikkal, who scored a 42-ball 56 at the top.,“Brilliant young player, he (Padikkal) has shown it over the last couple of years in domestic cricket, U-19 cricket, how talented he is and how destructive he could be at the top of the order. I loved opening with him. He is such an exciting young player. My advice is to play your natural game and if you are feeling it against the particular bowler keep going. Play nice and smart, and then my role changes a little bit,” Warner said.,Asked if the team was worried when Manish Pandey and Jonny Bairstow was going strong, Finch said: “We knew that if we can open one end and get a new batter in, guys who come in in the middle order, it is not easy to get away to a flyer with the slowness of the wicket, we knew we had to hang in there.”,“Yuzi (Chahal) was exceptional with the ball. I think he showed his class and experience tonight. He is very experienced in international cricket where you are playing in a lot of conditions with heavy dew as well. He is an ultimate professional and he got the job done under pressure which was outstanding,” he added. PTI","Sep 22, 2020

"Kings XI Punjab have appealed against on-field umpire Nitin Menon’s controversial ‘short run’ call at a crucial phase of their IPL match against Delhi Capitals.,Before the match went into Super Over on Sunday night, TV footage showed that square leg umpire Menon had erred in calling Chris Jordan for a ‘short run’ on the third ball of the 19th over, bowled by Kagiso Rabada of Delhi Capitals. TV replays showed that Jordan’s bat was inside the crease when he completed the run.,However, to KXIP’s horror, Menon gestured that Jordan has not completed the run and only one run instead of two was awarded to Mayank Agarwal and the team. The decision was not reversed despite technological evidence that it was a wrong call. In the final over, Punjab needed 13 runs to win and Agarwal managed 12 runs on the first three balls. If that one run erroneously deducted by Menon were credited to the total, Punjab would have won with three balls to spare. But they lost two wickets on the final two balls and the match spilled into a Super Over, in which they lost.,KXIP CEO Satish Menon said the team has appealed to the match referee regarding Nitin Menon’s incorrect decision. However, the appeal is unlikely to yield any result since the rules say only a prompt change of the umpire’s decision is allowed, but “the umpire’s decision, once made, is final.” — PTI,Former India batsman Sanjay Manjrekar is of the view that the third umpire should have intervened after Nitin Menon made the incorrect decision. “Had the third umpire intervened and let Menon know that it wasn’t short and had Menon changed his decision, I don’t think anybody would have had any problem with that,” Manjrekar said.,KXIP co-owner and Bollywood actress Preity Zinta said that rules need to be changed. “... it’s also important to ask for policy changes that improve the game in the future for everyone. The past has happened and it’s important to move on,” she tweeted.,Former India batsman Virender Sehwag lashed out at Menon, saying: “Short Run nahin tha. And that was the difference.”,Dubai: Kings XI Punjab batsman Mayank Agarwal said it feels terrible to not close out the game after making a stupendous comeback against Delhi Capitals. Chasing 158 to win, KXIP were looking down the barrel at 55/5 but Agarwal’s blistering 89-run knock took them to 157. They needed one run off the final two balls but Marcus Stoinis’ twin strikes took the game to the Super Over, which KXIP lost. “We had a tough day,” Agarwal said. “There are a lot of positives to take. The way we came back was fantastic. The way we bowled with the new ball was terrific. It really hurts to not close out the game from the situation we were in, feels terrible,” he added. “This is just the first game. We can get things rolling again. I think to play a game like that first up was fantastic.”,Dubai: Devdutt Padikkal displayed his highly-rated talent with a half-century on IPL debut before AB de Villiers provided the much-needed final flourish to take Royal Challengers Bangalore to 163/5 in their tournament opener against Sunrisers Hyderabad.

"Abu Dhabi, September 22,Grace and strength will be on one side while poise and killer instinct on the other when a revamped Kolkata Knight Riders take on Mumbai Indians, who have once again faltered in the beginning of the IPL, on Wednesday.,Since 2013, Mumbai Indians have never won an opening game and the script didn’t change against Chennai Super Kings, who took control of the match during the last 10 overs of the first innings.,They will be keen to bounce back while KKR would look for a perfect beginning as it will be a battle between big hitters on both sides on a sluggish Abu Dhabi track.,It will be Shubman Gill’s third IPL, the one where he would like to own the stage with his languid grace and effortless hitting, which he is so capable of. He can hit sixes over extra cover with grace and caress the ball through covers too.,These are exactly the traits that made Rohit Sharma, the great white ball exponent that he is. Seasoned Rohit versus young Shubman is one for the keeps and makes this battle enticing.,But it’s not just grace which makes T20 so appealing. The brute masculinity of power that sends the ball soaring into the orbit is what makes it so special.,Hardik Pandya, who is back with a chiselled body. There is no doubt that he can unleash his firepower against Sunil Narine and Kuldeep Yadav as well as KKR’s highest-paid multi-million dollar recruit Pat Cummins. The second pacer could be between Prasidh Krishana and Kamlesh Nagarkoti.,But Hardik will find his match in Andre Russell, easily the most destructive hitter in current T20 cricket.,Russell had openly criticised the team management last year for sending him down the order. He had hit 52 sixes during one of KKR’s worst editions.,But this time, he has been promised a promotion to number three slot and this could spell doom for any opposition.,“If it benefits the team and helps us win games, why not. If that meant Russell comes in at three and bats 60 balls, he might actually make a double hundred. Anything can happen with Dre Russ,” KKR mentor David Hussey had said recently.,KKR has Eoin Morgan, easily the best white ball captain in international cricket at the moment, who could advise Dinesh Karthik on how to tackle tense moments.,Whether he would fit in among the four overseas players is the question as Knights have Narine, Tom Banton, Russell and Cummins, who walk into any T20 playing XI.,For Mumbai, it is important that Nathan Coulter-Nile, with more all-round T20 utility compared to Trent Boult, gets fit to add more balance.,On Saturday, despite a strong start, Mumbai Indians were reduced to 162/9 and they could think about using Ishan Kishan’s explosive firepower rather than bulky Saurabh Tiwary, who can’t rotate the strike with ease.,Pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah had a rare off-day, leaking 43 runs against CSK and he would like to hit the straps once again.,Apart from pacers and spinners Krunal Pandya and Rahul Chahar, they need one more option in the bowling and that can be in form of Pandya and Kieron Pollard.,Both Hardik and Pollard, who did not bowl against CSK can jointly share the responsibility of another bowler., Dinesh Karthik (C), Eoin Morgan, Nitish Rana, Rahul Tripathi, Rinku Singh, Shubman Gill, Siddhesh Lad, Ali Khan, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Kuldeep Yadav, Lockie Ferguson, Pat Cummins, Prasidh Krishna, Sandeep Warrior, Shivam Mavi, Varun Chakravarthy, Andre Russell, Chris Green, M Siddharth, Sunil Narine, Nikhil Naik, Tom Banton., Rohit Sharma (C), Aditya Tare, Anmolpreet Singh, Anukul Roy, Chris Lynn, Dhawal Kulkarni, Digvijay Deshmukh, Hardik Pandya, Ishan Kishan, James Pattison,  Jasprit Bumrah, Jayant Yadav, Kieron Pollard, Krunal Pandya, Mitchell McClenaghan, Mohsin Khan, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Prince Balwant Rai, Quinton De Kock, Rahul Chahar, Saurabh Tiwary, Sherfane Rutherford, Suryakumar Yadav, Trent Boult.

One of our strengths is the variety we have in our pace department. All four Indian pacers are shaping up really well. It's going to be a hard decision to make who's going to start the tournament,"" said Karthik.,The first two matches have witnessed scores in the region of 160 and Karthik said it seemed to be the number in the IPL in UAE this time.,""Looking at the games so far, I think 160 is a par score on most grounds. But there's no reason why a higher total can't be achieved. But yes, 160 is a very interesting number this year,"" said Karthik.,KKR have a lopsided head-to-head record against the four-time defending champions Mumbai Indians who have won 18 times from 23 encounters.,""It's good that we are playing them early in the tournament. They are a very solid side, we are aware of that.

Other teams start to do more research on you, and question you in certain ways with your own skill,"" said the former Kiwi captain.,McCullum further said the team might find themselves at home as the conditions look similar to that of Eden Gardens with the wickets aiding seam movements.,""I think the conditions are probably a little similar to Eden Gardens.

"Sharjah, September 22,Sanju Samson's effortless six-hitting exhibition along with Jofra Archer's magnificent all-round show formed the cornerstone of Rajasthan Royals' comfortable 16-run victory over Chennai Super Kings in an IPL match here on Tuesday.,Rated as the weakest among eight teams, Royals without a Ben Stokes or a Jos Buttler in their playing XI did most things right under skipper Steve Smith.,On a placid Sharjah track, Royals amassed 216 for 7 largely due to Samson's 74 off 32 balls that had nine maximums apart from a solitary boundary.,He found an able ally in skipper Steve Smith, who opened in T20 cricket for the first time in his career and scored 69 off 47 balls without much fuss while making a comeback to competitive cricket after a concussion break.,But it was Archer's four sixes off Lungi Ngidi in the final over that tilted the scales decisively with 30 runs coming off it.,Even going by the easy nature of the track, scoreboard pressure was always there and CSK still managed 200 for 6 with Archer (1/26 off 4 overs) swinging it in favour of Royals with a decisive 19th over.,Rahul Tewatia (3/37 in 4 overs) also need to be credited for his wickets at the top of the order.,It was always a catch-up game for CSK and one imagined that their skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni would at least try and come up the order but he came at No 7 when the match was as good as over.,The night belonged to Samson, a man rated for his talent but criticised for his lack of consistency. He always has one or two incredible IPL days every year. Tuesday was one such day when he was at his brilliant best.,Piyush Chawla after a dream start to his IPL career was hit for three sixes in one over by Samson, all clean hits that landed several rows behind. His skipper also joined the six hitting competition hitting four himself adding 121 for the second wicket in just 9.2 overs.,What stood out was the minimum effort he used in lofting the straight sixes as the bat looked like a mere extension of his hands.,Chawla (1/55) and Ravindra Jadeja (0/40 in 4 overs) were targeted keeping short boundaries in mind and 95 runs came off those 8 overs from slow bowlers.,Just when it looked that a century was there for taking, Samson was holed out at deep extra cover trying to hit Ngidi for a six.,Once Smith was out in the 18th over, a total of 200 that looked so imminent after first 10, started looking distant. Till Archer decided to use his bat like sword and scythed through a hapless Ngidi, who lost nerve and length simultaneously. Four sixes and 30 runs finally proved to be decisive.,CSK did try at one stage with Faf du Plessis (72 off 37 balls) launching into Jaydev Unadkat (0/44 in 4 overs)'s final over hitting him for three sixes and seven in all.,However Archer bowled a lethal short ball that grew big on Du Plessis to close in the match with Dhoni's (29 off 17 balls) three sixes in final over were in a lost cause.

That too when the match as a contest was over.,However, on a big Dubai ground with bigger-sized boundaries, the skipper can rotate the strike better unlike Sharjah and also take those extra deliveries to settle down.,For Delhi Capitals, winning a cliffhanger right at the onset would have given them a lot of confidence even though Ravichandran Ashwin’s probable absence after a shoulder injury could force them to reshuffle their bowling line-up.,Senior spinner Amit Mishra could be an option to partner Axar Patel in case Ashwin is unable to make it.,The cushion of bigger boundaries can always help a wrist spinner attack more by tossing the ball up.,Another aspect will be pacer Mohit Sharma’s performance.
