"Putting up a stout defence, iconic Sunil Gavaskar on Friday said neither he blamed Virat Kohli’s actor-wife Anushka Sharma for India captain’s failure nor he made any sexist remarks during an IPL match and his comments were being misinterpreted.,Kohli had a bad day in office on Thursday when he led Royal Challengers Bangalore against Kings XI Punjab. He dropped two catches of rival skipper KL Rahul and managed only a run off five balls in RCB’s chase.,While Kohli was still at crease, Gavaskar said India captain is keen to improve and he knows that he can do so only by practicing more and more. He then added that during the lockdown Kohli faced only Anushka’s bowling and it is showing that it did not help much.,Gavaskar was speaking in Hindi when he made the comment.,However, the comment did not go down well with Kohli and Anushka’s fans and some even demanded his sacking from Star Sports commentary panel, lashing out at him on social media.,Reacting to it, Anushka also issued a statement on her Instagram page and said that Gavaskar’s message was “distasteful”.,Gavaskar though said his comments were not understood in right context.,The remark according to Gavaskar was in reference to a video clip where Kohli and Anushka were seen enjoying some tennis ball cricket in their compound.,“Firstly, I would like to say, where am I blaming her, I’m not blaming her. I am only saying that the video showed she was bowling to Virat. Virat has only played that much bowling in this lockdown period,” Gavaskar told India Today channel.,“It is tennis ball fun game that people have to pass time during the lockdown, so that’s all, so where am I blaming her for Virat’s failures.”                 ,Gavaskar also rubbished allegations on social media that he made a “sexist comment”.,“I’m the one who has always batted for wives going with husbands on tours. I am the one who has always said that like a normal guy going to office for a 9-5 job, when he comes back home, he comes back to his wife, similarly why can’t cricketers have their wives with them,” Gavaskar said.,He also tried to explain his comment.,“As you can hear from the commentary, Aakash was talking about the fact there has been very little chance for any proper practice in the lockdown, for everybody...,“.....that has actually shown in rustiness of some of the players in their first matches. Rohit (Sharma) didn’t strike the ball well, now in the second match he has got runs, MSD (Mahendra Singh Dhoni) didn’t strike the ball well in the first match.”   ,He then also explained what exactly he said.                 ,“.....Anushka was bowling to him, so that’s what I said, that’s the only bowling, I have not used any other word. She was bowling to him, that’s all, where am I blaming her, where I am being sexist in this.”          ,“I’m just only stating what was seen on the video which was maybe recorded by somebody in the neighbouring buildings and put up and that’s the only thing I’m doing, but the point I’m making trying to make is that there was no practice for anybody including Virat in the lockdown., “...I have not been sexist, if somebody has interpreted it, what can I do,” Gavaskar said.

"Rome, September 26,Two months of physical training. Then three months of practice on clay courts. Followed by two straight titles on the red dirt.,Amid all the tumult of the coronavirus pandemic, Simona Halep might very well have found the perfect formula to prepare for the French Open.,When the clay-court Grand Slam tournament begins on Sunday, 2018 champion Halep will be on court against 70th-ranked Sara Sorribes Tormo.,“I was very strict to the schedule, and I have worked a lot and I have improved a lot physically,” Halep said of her time at home in Romania during the lockdown.,“That's why I can run, I can feel fit every match. My legs are stronger and stronger, which gives me confidence during the matches, and also on clay it's (helpful).”    ,Ranked second but seeded No. 1 at Roland Garros because defending champion Ash Barty is not playing, Halep enters with a 9-0 record since tennis restarted, with titles on clay in Prague and Rome — and a 14-match winning streak that dates to February.,Separated from her Australian coach Darren Cahill for seven months during the pandemic, Halep spent the extended break from competition with her Romanian coach, Artemon Apostu-Efremov.,“First part of pandemic, it was mostly physical, because in Romania we weren't allowed to do any tennis until 15th of May,” Apostu-Efremov told The Associated Press.,“Then when it was possible to go out and play again … all our practice was on clay.,“We've been, for a while, on clay,"" he said, ""and you get more used (to) the bounce, with the angles, and I hope this will be an advantage for her.”   ,Another possible edge for Halep: She didn't play the recently concluded US Open, having decided against traveling overseas due to health concerns amid the pandemic. So she wasn't worn down by a deep run in New York — or even just the travel and jet lag — like many of her main challengers.,At the Italian Open, Halep's final three matches came against Yulia Putintseva, Garbiñe Muguruza and Karolína Pliskova — all three of whom played at the US Open.,Putintseva and Pliskova each retired because of injury after losing the first set to Halep, while Muguruza was methodically worn down over the course of a long three-setter.,With the French Open being rescheduled from its usual May-June slot to late September and early October, cooler and wetter-than-usual weather could play to Halep's strongpoint: outlasting opponents over long rallies with her fluid movement and improved stamina.,“To play (an) aggressive game against her is going to be quite tough,” said Pliskova.,“And she (already) had big success in Paris, so I think she's going to be one of my favorites to go for the title.”,Halep's decision to sit out the US Open was made with the same logic she used when she decided not to compete in the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics due to concerns over the Zika virus.,“If I don't feel relaxed mentally about the health, I don't go,” she said.,“So that's why I didn't play Olympics few years ago. That's why I didn't play US Open. I just feel stressed. And when I feel stressed, I prefer to stay home.” ,While virus cases are increasing across France — the number of spectators at the French Open has been dropped to 1,000 per day — Halep clearly feels comfortable in Paris, a city she calls her “favorite”.,Having previously lost two French Open finals, Halep claimed her first Grand Slam title at Roland Garros two years ago by rallying from a set down to beat Sloane Stephens. Halep added a second major trophy by dropping only four games against Serena Williams in last year's Wimbledon final.,So consider Halep, who can reclaim the top-ranking from Barty if she wins Roland Garros again, ready to deal with the expectations of being a favorite.,“She has big expectations of herself,” said Apostu-Efremov.,“This is a strange year and everyone has to adapt to the new environment, new conditions, (fewer) spectators. Some do it better, some miss some of this old stuff.”,Halep, it seems, is better prepared than ever. AP","Sep 26, 2020

"Barcelona, September 25,Lionel Messi criticised the exit of teammate and good friend Luis Suárez on Friday, dealing another blow to the damaged relationship between the Argentine and Barcelona's leadership.,Messi posted a photo of himself with Suárez on Instagram with a message expressing his sadness for his friend's departure and his anger at how the club transferred him to Atlético Madrid.,“It is going to be so strange seeing you in another shirt, and even stranger to have to play against you,” Messi wrote.,“You deserved a sending-off fit for what you are: one of the most important players in club history, both for what you did for the group and individually — not the one they gave you. But it is true that at this point nothing surprises me.”     ,Barcelona decided to overhaul its squad after the 8-2 loss to Bayern Munich in the Champions League last month.,The 33-year-old Suárez was told by incoming coach Ronald Koeman that he was no longer wanted. The club, hard hit financially by the coronavirus pandemic, also needed to reduce its expenditures on salaries for its players.,Suárez bid farewell to Barcelona's fans in an emotional news conference on Thursday. He leaves Camp Nou as the club's third leading scorer with 198 goals.,The Uruguayan helped Barcelona win 13 titles since arriving in 2014 from Liverpool, including four Spanish league trophies and the Champions League in 2015.,Suárez forged a dynamic scoring duo with Messi over the years, and the two South Americans became neighbors and fast friends, along with their families.,“I was accepting the idea (of your departure), but not until I entered the changing room did I realize what it means,” Messi wrote.,“How difficult it is going to be not sharing each day with you, both on and off the field. We will miss you very much. These have been many years of many mates, lunches, dinners ... many things I won't forget from all those days together.” ,Barcelona transferred Suárez to Spanish league rival Atlético for 6 million euros ($7 million).,Messi had tried to leave the club he has been a part of for 20 years after the debacle against Bayern, but Barcelona replied that he must finish the final year of his contract.,Suárez also took Messi's side in the dispute on Thursday when he said: “I have to accept it if the club decides it is time that I go, just like the club should accept it if a player wants to leave.”      ,Messi, however, has already given up in trying to leave this season. He has vowed to play his hardest for the team while he remains — even if he is even more disgruntled after Suárez's departure.,Messi's comments are the latest run-in between him and the club's board. Club president Josep Bartomeu has called for elections in March, in which he cannot run again, but he is also facing a censure referendum that could oust him and his board in the coming weeks.

"New Delhi, September 25,Sachin Tendulkar has no doubts in his mind that  Dean Jones would have been one of the ""most sought after batsmen"" if he were to be part of the T20 generation and called him a player well ahead of his time.,The 59-year-old former Australia batsman died of cardiac arrest in a Mumbai hotel on Thursday. He was in India as a part of host broadcaster's commentary panel.,Tendulkar, who fondly remembers his on-field battles during the Australia tour of 1991-92, said he would be glued to TV set as a young cricketer when Jones batted.,Such was his fearless style of play that he would have excelled in T20 cricket, feels the Indian legend.,""He would have been hundred per cent one of the most popular T20 players without any doubt,"" Tendulkar told PTI during a conversation, his voice tinged with sadness.,""Had there been an auction, Deano would have been a player much in-demand. He was an innovative stroke player, a fantastic runner between the wickets and a brilliant fielder, everything that you require for T20s.""     ,Tendulkar believes that Jones' quality to improvise in ODIs would mean that he was aware about the demands of the game and played as per the situation.,""Since he was such a good ODI player, he would have adapted to the ever changing rules of T20 better. Cricket formats are dynamic and I believe he had that quality to evolve as per demands and would have made a terrific T20 player."",Tendulkar remembered how Jones used to charge down the track to fast bowlers even in the mid and late 80's when aggressive batting wasn't exactly in vogue.,""Whatever cricket he played in the 80's and early 90's, he was ahead of his time. He would charge the fast bowlers and that was back in 80's.,""We talk about innovations but remember some shots that are being played today, the earlier generations have also played, well before even we started and Deano was one of them,"" he said.,Tendulkar remembered the 1986 tied Test. He was 13 then and a trainee at Ramakant Achrekar's academy at Shivaji Park Gymkhana and how Jones' 210 made all the youngsters interested about the Australian.,""I remember I was 13 when tied Test happened and he scored that double hundred.,""When I went to Australia for the first time in 1991-92, they were a great team. There was David Boon, Geoff Marsh, Steve Waugh, Bruce Reid and Craig McDermott but for us in the Indian team, there were two players we spoke about most — AB (skipper Allan Border) and Deano (Dean Jones).,""Literally No. 1 and 2 key players for us and then there was McDermott,"" Tendulkar recollected.,The attribute of Jones that has always stayed with Tendulkar was his fearlessness while facing fast bowlers on bouncy tracks and at times without helmets.,""I enjoyed watching him bat and at times without the helmet. What stood out was not just his contributions for Australia but that he was an entertainer-par-excellence.,""You can't deny that your eyeballs glued to the TV when Deano batted and you didn't want to miss that chance.""     ,Tendulkar remembered how Jones scored a match-winning knock against India in a 1992 World Cup game in Brisbane and how that loss hurt.,""You never enjoyed when he scored against India and Brisbane game was one such game (Jones scored 90). And then, we were docked three overs and the run reduced from Australia's total was one. Such a rule made it difficult for us,"" Tendulkar remembered as if it was yesterday.,He finds it difficult to believe that Jones is no more.,""It's a better pill to swallow. Whatever you say, it is a massive tragedy. My heart goes out to his friends and family. Just think of it, he was only 59 years old.   He may have had so much to contribute.

However, NRAI wants to restart sporting activities and start preparations for the busy 2022 calendar, which includes the Commonwealth and Asian Games.,Also, it is understood that apart from the trap discipline, in which India might go unrepresented at the 2021 Olympics, the team for next year’s World Cup will consist of shooters who have won Olympics quotas for the country. “The Olympics team should be selected for the World Cups to get them into competition mode as the 2021 Games is our first priority,” Deepali Deshpande, chief coach of the Indian rifle team, told The Tribune. “Also, shooters from the non-Olympics events have been included because from January we will start selections and plans for the Asian and Commonwealth Games.”,Chandigarh: Chandigarh’s Gurjoat Siingh Khangura (in pic), who is part of the core group of Indian shooters for the Tokyo Olympics 2021 in skeet, has signed up with PlayWrite Foundation, which will represent him in commercial engagements. PlayWrite has ventured into sports management with this signing, but since it is a non-profit, funds generated will be used to support young girls in sport.,Subject to approval from the Sports Authority of India (SAI), the rifle and pistol camp is scheduled to be held from October 5 to November 8 and the shotgun camp on October 20-30. Interestingly, NRAI has made attending the camp optional and it will seek the shooters’ opinion once it gets the approval from SAI. “Proposal has been sent to SAI for approval. Strict compliance of SOP issued by MHA and Covid test by a Govt authorised Lab is must for all Shooters and coaches,” NRAI stated. “The test report should not be older than 48 hours from joining the camp on 5th October 2020 (Rifle/Pistol). This report will have to be submitted at the time of joining the camp. No personal coaches/parents/ guests will be allowed to enter the range. Detailed circular will be issued on receipt of approval of SAI.”,The original plan was to call for the camp only those shooters who compete in the Olympics disciplines, but NRAI has included other shooters after a few coaches insisted.,However, not everyone is on board.

"Madrid, September 24,Lionel Messi will be there when Barcelona starts its season on Sunday, just as he has been for the last two decades.,His every move, however, will be scrutinised like never before.,After all, never before had Messi told the club that he wanted to leave, and never before had Messi been forced to stay.,Will Messi still give his best? Will he still be motivated? Will the transfer saga affect him? Some of those questions may start being answered on Sunday when Barcelona opens its Spanish league season against Villarreal at the Camp Nou.,It will be the club's league debut after the first two matches were postponed because of its participation in the Champions League late last season.,The team's last official match was the embarrassing 8-2 loss to Bayern Munich in the Champions League quarterfinals in August, one of the worst defeats in the club's history and in Messi's career. The result thrust Barcelona into one of its worst crises ever, and led Messi to make public his desire to leave.,The Argentina great eventually backtracked after Barcelona denied his request to leave for free. He said he didn't want to get into a legal dispute with the “club of his life”.       ,But Messi made it more than clear that he would have rather left, and openly criticised club president Josep Bartomeu for not keeping his promise to let him go.,Still, Messi said he would give his best despite having wanted to leave, and there were no signs of any letdown in the preparation matches in which he played ahead of what should be his final season with the club.,“For a moment I thought he wouldn't stay with us,” said Barcelona teammate Sergi Roberto.,“He's our captain, the best player this club has ever had and the best player in the history of soccer. I couldn't imagine Barça without Leo. It's normal that he may have wanted a different experience, but he has given it all for this club throughout the years. He has been motivated since he came to the first team. He is very professional.” ,Messi stayed but Barcelona will have a new coach as part of the profound changes announced by the club following the loss to Bayern.,Ronald Koeman arrived to replace Quique Setién, and it didn't take long before the Dutch coach said he wanted to revamp the squad. Barcelona will start the season without some of its key players from recent years, including Ivan Rakitic, who rejoined Sevilla, and Luis Suárez, who joined rival Atlético Madrid.,Also new for Barcelona is the fact that it will be coming off a trophy-less season for the first time since 2007-08. The team finished five points behind Real Madrid in the league last season despite having the lead when the competition was interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic with 11 matches remaining.,Defending champion Real Madrid has a difficult second match on Saturday against Real Betis, which has won two in a row to start the season under veteran Chilean coach Manuel Pellegrini, a former Madrid coach.,Madrid struggled in attack in its opening 0-0 draw at Real Sociedad last Sunday, when Eden Hazard still wasn't available. It remains unlikely that Hazard will be fit to face Betis at the Benito Villamarín Stadium.,Atlético will make its Spanish league debut on Sunday against Granada at the Wanda Metropolitano Stadium, but it's unclear if Suárez will be ready to play after joining from Barcelona.,Diego Costa was set to be in the attack after Álvaro Morata joined Juventus to open space for Suárez.,Like Atlético and Barcelona, Sevilla also had its first two matches postponed because of European competition after winning the Europa League in August. And it's opener on Sunday at promoted Cádiz will come only three days after it plays Bayern Munich in the Super Cup. AP","Sep 24, 2020

"Paris, September 25,For all of the many qualities contributing to Rafael Nadal's unprecedented superiority at the French Open — the bullwhip of a high-bouncing lefty forehand, the reflex returns, the cover-every-corner athleticism, the endless energy and grit — there's one element that stands above all the rest.,According to the opponent Nadal beat in the last two finals in Paris, anyway.,“You go into the match knowing that even your best tennis, even if you play it over three, four hours, might not be enough. I mean, if you do it, you maybe have a little chance, but you have to go to your limit on every single rally, every single point,"" Dominic Thiem, who won the US Open less than two weeks ago, told The Associated Press.,“That makes it not easy to go into the match,” said Thiem.   “And that's the mental part, I guess.”,When main-draw competition begins on Sunday at Roland Garros, Thiem and every other player in the men's bracket will be pursuing Nadal as the 34-year-old from Spain in pursuit of history.,If Nadal manages to claim a 13th French Open championship — extending his own record for the most singles trophies won by anyone at any major tennis tournament — he would, more significantly, also collect his 20th Grand Slam title overall, tying Roger Federer's record for a man.,Nadal's tally elsewhere: four US Opens, two Wimbledons, one Australian Open.,Asked recently about the possibility of catching the 39-year-old Federer, out for the rest of the season after a pair of operations on his right knee, Nadal expressed a sentiment he's uttered before.,Climbing the Grand Slam list, Nadal said, was “not an obsession at all”.,“I know that you put a lot of attention on all of this,” he replied when the topic was raised last week at the Italian Open, Nadal's first tournament since February because of the coronavirus pandemic.,“Of course I would love to finish my career with 25, but (that's) something that probably will not happen. I'm going to keep fighting to produce chances, and then when I finish my career, let's see, no?” he said.,“I just want to keep enjoying tennis. And that's it. If I am playing well, I know I normally have my chances. If not, going to be impossible. That's it.”     ,There is, of course, another great of the game playing during this era and, like Nadal, gaining on Federer.,That would be No. 1-ranked Novak Djokovic, who had won five of seven major titles to raise his total to 17 before being disqualified at the US Open for accidentally hitting a line judge with a ball while walking to a changeover.,In this oddest of years, the Grand Slam season will be drawing to a close in France; the clay-court major was postponed from May until now because of the coronavirus pandemic.,“Roland Garros is the last Slam, the last opportunity of this season. So we all know who the main favorite is there: Obviously, it's Nadal. And everything that he has achieved there, losing maybe a couple matches in his entire career on that court ... is probably the most impressive record that anybody has on any court,” said Djokovic.,“So, yeah, of course you would put him right there in front as a favorite to win it.”,For the record: Nadal has won 93 of 95 matches in the French Open and his last 21 in a row.,So what makes him so dominant there?,“He's an unbelievably great tennis player. Probably on clay, a little bit better than on the other surfaces,” said Thiem.,“He's left-handed, which makes it very uncomfortable. And then his forehand, the topspin on the clay, it's cruel to play.”       ,Thiem takes notes and hopes to emulate aspects of Nadal's game. So do others.,In Rome, for example, two-time Grand Slam champion Simona Halep and one of her coaches, Artemon Apostu-Efremov, caught one of Nadal's training sessions.,“We were watching the way he hits the ball, the acceleration, the energy he has on the court and the way he practices 100 per cent. It's always an inspiration,” said Apostu-Efremov.,“This dedication on the court and focus on court,” he said, “It's something that, for sure, could be transferred to Simona.”,Nadal wound up losing his third match in Italy, which is neither ideal form nor the sort of prep work he is accustomed to ahead of Paris.,Maybe he sensed that coming, because he talked before his loss about returning to “competition without big expectations”. Still, Nadal at the French Open is unlike anyone else, anywhere else.,“Regardless of how he feels, I'm sure he'll find a way,” said Stefanos Tsitsipas, a 2019 Australian Open semifinalist seeded No. 5 in Paris.,“He always finds a way, every single year. Clay is his surface. I'm sure he's going to do well.”  AP","Sep 25, 2020

"Paris, September 25,Already repeatedly trimmed, crowd sizes for the French Open have been reduced again ahead of play starting this weekend — to only 1,000 spectators per day — because of the worsening coronavirus epidemic in Paris.,The new limit, reduced from 5,000 per day, was first announced by Prime Minister Jean Castex on Thursday. His office confirmed on Friday that the reduction relates only to spectators, not to players, coaches, organisers and others working at Roland Garros, as Castex first said, causing initial confusion.,“It's a bit of a tough blow,” tournament director Guy Forget said Friday on Franceinfo radio.,Tickets will be refunded “with a bit of heartache because we are convinced that we would have been able to welcome the 5,000 people in question who we had been counting on"", he said.,""Unfortunately, that is the way it is,"" Forget added.,As virus cases have climbed, organisers have repeatedly had to scale back their ambitions. They had been planning, just three weeks ago, to have 11,500 spectators per day, split between three show courts at the Roland Garros site that has been revamped with a new all-weather movable roof for the central Philippe Chatrier arena.,That was then scaled back to 5,000 per day in all and, now, to only 1,000, as Paris and its immediate suburbs this week joined a growing list of French cities with tightened restrictions on crowds and other activities.,The measures are the latest government efforts to combat increasing virus cases and hospitalisations. France reported more than 16,000 new cases on Thursday alone, a new daily high, and new influxes of sick patients are putting mounting pressure on hospital ICU units.,For Roland Garros, that means less freedom than was accorded the Tour de France, which got to Paris last weekend without any positive cases among the 176 riders who took part in the three-week race. The Tour, in hindsight, was luckier than the French Open with its timing, squeezing through what is now becoming a rapidly closing window for events with sizable crowds.,Roland Garros organisers are subjecting players to multiple tests, which Forget said would be repeated every five days if they stay in the draw. Rather than make their own arrangements, players are also being grouped together in two Paris hotels, on floors reserved for them and where employees are tested, too. Vehicles that are disinfected after each trip ferry them to Roland Garros. Players have been posting photos of the Eiffel Tower from inside their hotel bubbles.,Forget said the system won't be quite as strict as at the US Open in New York.,“It's practically impossible to create a totally hermetic bubble,” he said.,Play begins Sunday and ends on October 11.

I had a chat with Maxi (Glenn Maxwell) yesterday, he asked me how I was feeling, I said I was not feeling completely in control of my batting and he said you must be joking, you are hitting really well,” Rahul said at the post-match presentation.,He had already spoken about his fears leading up to the IPL, considering he was coming back after a five-month-long break due to the COVID-19 pandemic.,“Quite honestly, I was nervous but I knew if I spend time in the middle, hit a few balls from the middle of the bat, it will all settle down. I try to do (the same routine as I did when I was a player) but as a captain, you have shortened time and you are running around and doing a lot of things,” Rahul said.,He is captaining in the IPL for the first time.,“I still try to maintain the same routine. Once I am in the middle and during the toss is the only time I feel like a captain and otherwise I try to balance being a player and the captain,” he said.,After Rahul starred with the bat, KXIP bowlers put a disciplined performance to bundle out RCB for 109 in 17 overs.,“It’s as complete a team performance as it can get. We had a few different plans going into this game. We knew RCB have a power-packed batting line up and we had to get 2-3 wickets up front and that also meant putting runs on the board, we know what these guys can do if they get set.

"Rohit Mahajan,Dean Jones, who died at age 59 today in Mumbai, breathed his last in a land of two of his greatest triumphs — in another Indian megacity, then known as Madras, he played one of the greatest innings seen in India; in yet another megacity, then known as Calcutta, he won the World Cup as part of Allan Border’s young team that breathed new fire into Australian cricket.,The 1986 knock in the Madras tied Test became part of folklore. Playing only his third Test, Jones, then 25, battled heat and humidity for eight hours to score 210 in Australia’s first innings of 574/7. The temperature hovered around 40°C most of the time he batted, the humidity was 80 per cent. The sea is close to the stadium in the city; the Australian players were also bothered by the strong stench from Cooum river, which, really, is more a squalid nullah than a river.,Jones, who had been sick the night before the match started, batted through severe dehydration and nausea; he threw up at the ground during drinks breaks. He cramped all over his body. He lost control of his bodily functions — he later revealed that he was so sick, he could not stop urinating in his trousers. He said he batted only by memory and instinct, not by method and planning.,“I didn’t drink anything apart from a cup of tea or coffee. We didn’t know anything about dehydration and rehydration back then,” he said in an interview. “Then I just batted from memory basically. I can’t remember much from 120 on. I know nearly every shot in every innings I played. I can’t remember a thing after 120 in that innings.”,“I’ll never forget how, after more than eight hours at the crease, his physical appearance had changed,” Steve Waugh, later his captain, wrote in his autobiography. “He was gaunt and pale in the face and had a vacant expression that suggested he was in serious trouble, his body bordering on completely shutting down.”,Jones was taken to hospital after that knock and administered a saline drip. Jones had been challenged to show his toughness by his flinty, irascible captain, Allan Border. It was a nightmare, but it also made Jones a legend at 25. His third Test saw Jones display his great spirit and iron will, amazing to see in an inexperienced batsman.,Genius strokeplayer,He also possessed great flamboyance and was among the pioneers of the breathtaking high-ball strokeplay that has come to define our era. He seemed to be bursting with nervous energy — he would take a step down, flex his arms for a quick backlift and bring down the bat with great force, often with only a soft cap on his head, with a mop of yellow hair peeping at back. In his audacious strokes, you can glimpse a bit of Ricky Ponting, and in his free-spiritedness, you can spot a bit of Adam Gilchrist or Andrew Symonds.,Jones was a fitting precursor to the great Aussie ODI players of the 1990s and 2000s, who won the World Cup three times in a row from 1999 to 2007, and again in 2015. His own World Cup win came in Calcutta in 1987, with him finishing the tournament as his team’s top middle-order batsman with 314 runs at 44.85.,Since he last played for Australia way back in 1994, most Indian fans know him as Prof Deano, a cheerful and excitable commentator.,The sadness that has engulfed the world of cricket is a reflection of the love fans and cricketers had for Jones, the golden boy of the 1980s who went too early at only 59.","Sep 25, 2020

"Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Virat Kohli took the blame for his team’s 97-run thrashing by Kings XI Punjab in the Indian Premier League here. Kohli took the blame for dropping Kings XI Punjab skipper KL Rahul twice, which contributed significantly to their defeat on Thursday.,Kohli felt had he not dropped Rahul, who remained unbeaten on 132, KXIP would not have been able to go past the 200-run mark. “I have to stand in front and take the brunt of it,” Kohli said. “Not the best day in office, couple of important chances of KL when he was set and that cost us 35-40 runs at a later stage. Maybe if we restricted them to 180 we wouldn’t have been under pressure from ball one of the chase,” he added.,KXIP posted 206/3 and RCB were bundled out for 109 in 17 overs. “We know exactly where we went wrong and I have to put my hand up and say a couple of important chances went down,” Kohli said. “There are days when these kinds of things happen on the cricket field and we have to accept them. We have had a good game (against Sunrisers Hyderabad), we have had a bad game and now it is time to move on and learn from the mistakes we made,” he added.,KXIP skipper Rahul said he was lacking in confidence heading into the team’s second IPL fixture. “I have actually been not so confident,” Rahul said. “I had a chat with Maxi (Glenn Maxwell). He said ‘how are you feeling’. I said ‘I am not feeling completely in control of my batting’. He said ‘you must be joking, you are hitting really well’,” he added.,“Quite honestly I was nervous but I knew if I spend time in the middle, hit a few balls from the middle of the bat, it will all settle down,” Rahul said. — PTI","Sep 26, 2020

"Dubai, September 26,Chennai Super Kings head coach Stephen Fleming has admitted that his side were “a little bit muddled” at the moment and they need a clearer strategy going ahead after suffering two losses in three matches in the Indian Premier League.,Fleming also rued the missing of some key players that he said has affected the team combination.,“Well, we’re a bit muddled at the moment. We’re missing some key players, and we’re trying to find a balance that allows us to be competitive. We’re looking to develop a personality based on the wickets that we’re facing,” Fleming said after CSK lost to Delhi Capitals by 44 runs on Friday.,“Each wicket has been completely different, and our batting is without Rayudu, (Suresh) Raina etc. We’re trying to find a way or a combination and how to use players. We’ve learned a massive amount over three days,” he added.,Three-time champion CSK could not get going during the run chase against DC, and when asked why Sam Curran or Ravindra Jadeja was not promoted up the batting order, Fleming said they had used the same tactic in the last couple of games.,“We have almost got too many batting options at the moment, so that’s why I say we were a little bit muddled with what we’re sending out, so we just need to be a little bit clearer with what we’re doing, and perhaps what we’re missing is a bigger contribution at the top,” he said.,“It’s a lot of question marks and a lot of soul-searching from coaching point of view and strategy point of view, but we’re trying to find combinations where we get the best players at right times. To keep shunting the order all over the place is not really our style, but we’ve had a go at it and we’ll review how it’s gone.”,Spin bowling has been traditionally CSK’s strength but struggling at the moment, prompting Fleming to say it was an area of concern.,“Yeah, it’s an area of concern, because it’s been such a strength for CSK, and you’ve got to think that the style of play that we’ve developed over the last 12 years is heavily based on spin. So what we’re trying to do is find a different personality.,“Spin still plays a part, and we’ve played on three different grounds, so each game has been different conditions. We’re struggling to adjust to find the pace and the style to bowl through the middle, and that, in the last two games in particular, has been an area where we haven’t done so well. So from a strength to an area of concern, we need to rectify that.”,Asked about the possible team combination in the upcoming matches, Fleming said, “All bets are on the table at the moment as we try to find a way. We are looking forward to playing a number of games here (in Dubai), we were interested in how this pitch played, and get conditions right so we can get right combination.” ,The former New Zealand captain said the dew factor was something that his side couldn’t anticipate.,“We did (consider batting first) but what we can’t anticipate is the dew. We trained across the road the other day and it was soaking wet and it has a huge impact in second innings. Tonight, it was absolutely none so it’s a little bit of hit and miss at the moment,” he said.,“The last game we played in Sharjah was one of the wetter surfaces we’ve been involved in. We’re guessing a little bit around conditions. We are the guinea pigs in terms of playing first games on two venues.”           ,CSK’s next match is against Sunrisers Hyderabad on October 2. — PTI","Sep 26, 2020

There was no dew, but the wicket did slow down. We are lacking a bit of steam in the batting and that hurts. The run rate keeps on mounting after such slow starts and adds pressure, we need to figure that out,” Dhoni said after the match against DC.,“We need to come back with a clearer picture, looking at the combination. Maybe, the team balance will get better once Rayudu comes back in the next game.”                ,Dhoni was referring to Ambati Rayudu who struck a brilliant 48-ball 71 in CSK’s five-wicket win over MI in the tournament opener before suffering a hamstring injury.,The CSK captain expressed hope that Rayudu will be available in their next game, which according to him will provide the much-needed balance to the side.,“That will give us the room to experiment with an extra bowler perhaps. There are quite a few things we can think about. We are one batter extra to start off, so the players need to step up.”      ,Dhoni also asked his bowlers to pull up their socks after two ordinary outings.,“We need to get better with our lengths, lines and pace. I think the spinners have not come to the party yet. We are bowling good deliveries, but we are giving away the boundary deliveries bit too often,” he said.,Barring some fielding lapses, Delhi Capitals captain Shreyas Iyer is happy with the performance of his side so far.,“I am really happy with the performance. I would give them the benefit of doubt, is tough to catch in these conditions. You misjudge the ball, really don’t know how to pace yourself,” he said.,“In the team meeting we decided that we are going to assess the batting conditions early and then play accordingly.
