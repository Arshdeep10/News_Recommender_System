"Dubai, September 26,Chennai Super Kings head coach Stephen Fleming has admitted that his side were “a little bit muddled” at the moment and they need a clearer strategy going ahead after suffering two losses in three matches in the Indian Premier League.,Fleming also rued the missing of some key players that he said has affected the team combination.,“Well, we’re a bit muddled at the moment. We’re missing some key players, and we’re trying to find a balance that allows us to be competitive. We’re looking to develop a personality based on the wickets that we’re facing,” Fleming said after CSK lost to Delhi Capitals by 44 runs on Friday.,“Each wicket has been completely different, and our batting is without Rayudu, (Suresh) Raina etc. We’re trying to find a way or a combination and how to use players. We’ve learned a massive amount over three days,” he added.,Three-time champion CSK could not get going during the run chase against DC, and when asked why Sam Curran or Ravindra Jadeja was not promoted up the batting order, Fleming said they had used the same tactic in the last couple of games.,“We have almost got too many batting options at the moment, so that’s why I say we were a little bit muddled with what we’re sending out, so we just need to be a little bit clearer with what we’re doing, and perhaps what we’re missing is a bigger contribution at the top,” he said.,“It’s a lot of question marks and a lot of soul-searching from coaching point of view and strategy point of view, but we’re trying to find combinations where we get the best players at right times. To keep shunting the order all over the place is not really our style, but we’ve had a go at it and we’ll review how it’s gone.”,Spin bowling has been traditionally CSK’s strength but struggling at the moment, prompting Fleming to say it was an area of concern.,“Yeah, it’s an area of concern, because it’s been such a strength for CSK, and you’ve got to think that the style of play that we’ve developed over the last 12 years is heavily based on spin. So what we’re trying to do is find a different personality.,“Spin still plays a part, and we’ve played on three different grounds, so each game has been different conditions. We’re struggling to adjust to find the pace and the style to bowl through the middle, and that, in the last two games in particular, has been an area where we haven’t done so well. So from a strength to an area of concern, we need to rectify that.”,Asked about the possible team combination in the upcoming matches, Fleming said, “All bets are on the table at the moment as we try to find a way. We are looking forward to playing a number of games here (in Dubai), we were interested in how this pitch played, and get conditions right so we can get right combination.” ,The former New Zealand captain said the dew factor was something that his side couldn’t anticipate.,“We did (consider batting first) but what we can’t anticipate is the dew. We trained across the road the other day and it was soaking wet and it has a huge impact in second innings. Tonight, it was absolutely none so it’s a little bit of hit and miss at the moment,” he said.,“The last game we played in Sharjah was one of the wetter surfaces we’ve been involved in. We’re guessing a little bit around conditions. We are the guinea pigs in terms of playing first games on two venues.”           ,CSK’s next match is against Sunrisers Hyderabad on October 2. — PTI","Sep 26, 2020

"Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Virat Kohli took the blame for his team’s 97-run thrashing by Kings XI Punjab in the Indian Premier League here. Kohli took the blame for dropping Kings XI Punjab skipper KL Rahul twice, which contributed significantly to their defeat on Thursday.,Kohli felt had he not dropped Rahul, who remained unbeaten on 132, KXIP would not have been able to go past the 200-run mark. “I have to stand in front and take the brunt of it,” Kohli said. “Not the best day in office, couple of important chances of KL when he was set and that cost us 35-40 runs at a later stage. Maybe if we restricted them to 180 we wouldn’t have been under pressure from ball one of the chase,” he added.,KXIP posted 206/3 and RCB were bundled out for 109 in 17 overs. “We know exactly where we went wrong and I have to put my hand up and say a couple of important chances went down,” Kohli said. “There are days when these kinds of things happen on the cricket field and we have to accept them. We have had a good game (against Sunrisers Hyderabad), we have had a bad game and now it is time to move on and learn from the mistakes we made,” he added.,KXIP skipper Rahul said he was lacking in confidence heading into the team’s second IPL fixture. “I have actually been not so confident,” Rahul said. “I had a chat with Maxi (Glenn Maxwell). He said ‘how are you feeling’. I said ‘I am not feeling completely in control of my batting’. He said ‘you must be joking, you are hitting really well’,” he added.,“Quite honestly I was nervous but I knew if I spend time in the middle, hit a few balls from the middle of the bat, it will all settle down,” Rahul said. — PTI","Sep 26, 2020

"Putting up a stout defence, iconic Sunil Gavaskar on Friday said neither he blamed Virat Kohli’s actor-wife Anushka Sharma for India captain’s failure nor he made any sexist remarks during an IPL match and his comments were being misinterpreted.,Kohli had a bad day in office on Thursday when he led Royal Challengers Bangalore against Kings XI Punjab. He dropped two catches of rival skipper KL Rahul and managed only a run off five balls in RCB’s chase.,While Kohli was still at crease, Gavaskar said India captain is keen to improve and he knows that he can do so only by practicing more and more. He then added that during the lockdown Kohli faced only Anushka’s bowling and it is showing that it did not help much.,Gavaskar was speaking in Hindi when he made the comment.,However, the comment did not go down well with Kohli and Anushka’s fans and some even demanded his sacking from Star Sports commentary panel, lashing out at him on social media.,Reacting to it, Anushka also issued a statement on her Instagram page and said that Gavaskar’s message was “distasteful”.,Gavaskar though said his comments were not understood in right context.,The remark according to Gavaskar was in reference to a video clip where Kohli and Anushka were seen enjoying some tennis ball cricket in their compound.,“Firstly, I would like to say, where am I blaming her, I’m not blaming her. I am only saying that the video showed she was bowling to Virat. Virat has only played that much bowling in this lockdown period,” Gavaskar told India Today channel.,“It is tennis ball fun game that people have to pass time during the lockdown, so that’s all, so where am I blaming her for Virat’s failures.”                 ,Gavaskar also rubbished allegations on social media that he made a “sexist comment”.,“I’m the one who has always batted for wives going with husbands on tours.

"Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni is not happy with the performance of both his batting and bowling units after his side suffered their second consecutive loss in the Indian Premier League.,After CSK’s 44-run defeat at the hands of Delhi Capitals here on Friday, Dhoni said his batting unit was lacking “a bit of steam” while the spinners were “yet to come to the party”.,It was CSK’s third match and second defeat after beating defending champions Mumbai Indians in the tournament opener.,“I don’t think it was a good game for us. There was no dew, but the wicket did slow down. We are lacking a bit of steam in the batting and that hurts. The run rate keeps on mounting after such slow starts and adds pressure, we need to figure that out,” Dhoni said after the match against DC.,“We need to come back with a clearer picture, looking at the combination. Maybe, the team balance will get better once Rayudu comes back in the next game.”                ,Dhoni was referring to Ambati Rayudu who struck a brilliant 48-ball 71 in CSK’s five-wicket win over MI in the tournament opener before suffering a hamstring injury.,The CSK captain expressed hope that Rayudu will be available in their next game, which according to him will provide the much-needed balance to the side.,“That will give us the room to experiment with an extra bowler perhaps. There are quite a few things we can think about. We are one batter extra to start off, so the players need to step up.”      ,Dhoni also asked his bowlers to pull up their socks after two ordinary outings.,“We need to get better with our lengths, lines and pace. I think the spinners have not come to the party yet. We are bowling good deliveries, but we are giving away the boundary deliveries bit too often,” he said.,Barring some fielding lapses, Delhi Capitals captain Shreyas Iyer is happy with the performance of his side so far.,“I am really happy with the performance. I would give them the benefit of doubt, is tough to catch in these conditions. You misjudge the ball, really don’t know how to pace yourself,” he said.,“In the team meeting we decided that we are going to assess the batting conditions early and then play accordingly.

"""The ability to decontaminate several of these masks while doctors are having a coffee break will lessen the chance that masks contaminated with Covid viruses would expose other patients,"" said study author Steven Chu from the Stanford University in the US.,According to the study, published in the journal ACS Nano, facing a shortage of the masks early this year, researchers considered a number of ways to disinfect them for reuse, including ultraviolet light, hydrogen peroxide vapours, autoclaves and chemical disinfectants.,The problem is that many of these methods degrade the N95 masks' filtering abilities so that at most they could be reused a few times.,In the new study, the research team focused their attention on a combination of heat and humidity to try to decontaminate masks.,The team first mixed up batches of SARS-CoV-2 virus in liquids designed to mimic the fluids that might spray out of our mouths when we cough, sneeze, sing or simply breathe.,They next sprayed droplets of the brew on a piece of melt-blown fabric, a material used in most N95 masks, and let it dry.,Finally, they heated their samples at temperatures ranging from 25 to 95 degrees Celsius for up to 30 minutes with relative humidity up to 100 per cent.,Higher humidity and heat substantially reduced the amount of virus the team could detect on the mask, although they had to be careful not to go too hot, which additional tests revealed could lower the material's ability to filter out virus-carrying droplets.,The sweet spot appeared to be 85 degrees Celsius with 100 per cent relative humidity - the team could find no trace of SARS-CoV-2 after cooking the masks under those conditions.,Additional results indicate masks could be decontaminated and reused upwards of 20 times and that the process works on at least two other viruses.,Researchers have known for a long time that heat and humidity are good ways to inactivate viruses - there hadn't been an urgent need for a detailed quantitative analysis of something like mask decontamination until now.,""The new data provide some quantitative guidance for the future,"" Chu noted.
