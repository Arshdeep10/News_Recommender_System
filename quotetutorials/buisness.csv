"Reliance Group chairman Anil Ambani has told a UK court that suggestions of his lavish tastes are speculative because his lifestyle is ""very disciplined"" as he gave evidence in a dispute involving a loan agreement with three Chinese banks.,The 61-year-old former billionaire appeared via video link from Mumbai before the High Court on Friday for compulsory cross-examination in aid of an asset disclosure order obtained by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd Mumbai Branch, China Development Bank and Exim Bank of China.,The order required Ambani to give full disclosure of all of his assets worldwide exceeding USD 100,000.,""My needs are not vast and my lifestyle is very disciplined,"" Ambani told the London court.,Asked about his fleet of luxury cars and other references to his lavish lifestyle as the counsel for the banks cross-examined him, the Reliance Communications chief dismissed them as ""speculative"" media stories.,""Mr Anil Ambani has always been a simple man of simple tastes, contrary to exaggerated perceptions of his flamboyance and lavish lifestyle,"" said a spokesperson for Anil Ambani.,""He is devoted to his family and company, an avid marathon runner, and deeply spiritual. He is also a lifelong vegetarian, teetotaller and non-smoker who would much rather watch a movie at home with his kids than go out on the town. Reports that suggest otherwise are completely misleading,"" the spokesperson said.,The dispute revolves around an alleged breach of a personal guarantee on a company debt refinancing loan of around USD 925 million dating back to February 2012.,Ambani denies providing authority for any such guarantee, resulting in the High Court action in the UK – the jurisdiction agreed upon as part of the terms of the loan agreement.,In May, the Commercial Division of the High Court of England and Wales in London had ruled that the personal guarantee was binding on Ambani and directed him to pay early USD 717 million to the three Chinese banks.,""The banks will use the information from the cross-examination to pursue all available legal avenues to protect their rights and recover the outstanding loans owed to them,” the banks said in a statement this week.,At a hearing in the case earlier in the year, a UK judge had ruled that he did not accept Ambani's defence that his net worth was nearly zero or that his family would not step in to assist him when ""push came to shove"".

"United Nations, September 24,Global labour income is estimated to have declined by 10.7 per cent or USD 3.5 trillion in the first three quarters of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the International Labour Organization (ILO) said on Wednesday.,“The devastating losses in working hours caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have brought a ‘massive’ drop in labour income for workers around the world,” the ILO said in its latest assessment of the effects of the pandemic on the world of work.,Global labour income is estimated to have declined by 10.7 per cent or USD 3.5 trillion in the first three quarters of 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. This figure excludes the income support provided through government measures.,The ILO said the biggest drop was in the lower-middle income countries, where the labour income losses reached 15.1 per cent, with the Americas being the hardest hit region at 12.1 per cent.,The ILO Monitor: COVID-19 and the world of work sixth edition also estimates that global working hour losses in the first nine months of 2020 have been “considerably larger” than previously estimated.,The revised estimate of the global working time lost in the second quarter of this year (compared to Q4 2019) is for 17.3 per cent, equivalent to 495 million full time equivalent (FTE) jobs. The working-hour losses are expected to remain high in the third quarter of 2020, at 12.1 per cent or 345 million FTE jobs.,The outlook for Q4 has worsened significantly since the last ILO Monitor was issued. Under the ILO’s baseline scenario, global working-hour losses are now projected to amount to 8.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2020 (compared to Q4 2019), which corresponds to 245 million FTE jobs. This is an increase from the ILO’s previous estimate of 4.9 per cent or 140 million FTE jobs.,The ILO said a reason for the estimated increases in working-hour losses is that workers in developing and emerging economies, especially those in informal employment, have been much more affected than by past crises. It also notes that the drop in employment is more attributable to inactivity than unemployment, with important policy implications.,“While many stringent workplace closures have been relaxed, there are significant variations between regions. 94 per cent of workers are still in countries with some sort of workplace restrictions and 32 per cent are in countries with closures for all but essential workplaces,” the agency said.,Workers in developing nations had also seen their income drop by more than 15 per cent, ILO Director-General Guy Ryder told journalists in Geneva.,“On top of this, these are the places where there are the weakest social protection systems, so there are very few resources or protections for working people to fall back upon,” he said. “If you look at it regionally, the Americas were worst-affected, with losses of 12.1 per cent.”     Ryder said while the governments of richer countries had shored up their economies with hundreds of billions of dollars, poorer nations had been unable to do the same. Without such fiscal stimulus, working hours losses would have been 28 per cent between April and June, instead of 17.3 per cent, he added.,In order for developing countries to reach the same ratio of stimulus to working hours lost as in high-income countries, they would need to inject a further USD 982 billion (USD 45 billion in low-income countries and USD 937 billion in lower-middle income countries). The stimulus gap for low-income countries amounts to less than one per cent of the total value of the fiscal stimulus packages announced by high-income countries.,This huge “fiscal stimulus gap” is even more worrying in the light of the social protection deficits in many developing countries. Moreover, some of these countries have also had to redirect public spending from other objectives in order to mitigate the labour market impact of the crisis, the ILO said.,“Just as we need to redouble our efforts to beat the virus, so we need to act urgently and at scale to overcome its economic, social and employment impacts. That includes sustaining support for jobs, businesses and incomes,” Ryder said.,“As the United Nations General Assembly gathers in New York, there is a pressing need for the international community to set out a global strategy for recovery through dialogue, cooperation and solidarity. No group, country or region can beat this crisis alone,” he added. PTI","Sep 24, 2020

"New Delhi, September 24,American cult bike manufacturer Harley Davidson on Thursday said it was discontinuing sales and manufacturing operations in India, a decade after it started selling its premium bikes in the country.,Industry sources said the company was looking to tie up with a partner to run its business in the country.,The India action will include an associated workforce reduction of approximately 70 employees, Harley-Davidson Inc said in an SEC filing.,The development is part of the company's global ""2020 Restructuring Activities"". In the second quarter of 2020, Harley-Davidson had initiated restructuring activities like workforce reduction and the termination of certain contracts that would result in the elimination of approximately 700 positions globally, including the termination of approximately 500 employees.,The Milwaukee-based company refers to restructuring actions related to employees and other services as 'The Rewire' .,In a separate statement, Harley-Davidson said it planned to close its manufacturing facility in Bawal (Haryana) and significantly reduce the size of its sales office in Gurugram.,The company's dealer network will continue to serve customers through the contract term, Harley Davidson said, adding it is communicating with its customers in India and will keep them updated on future support.,""As part of The Rewire, an overhaul of its operating model and market structure, the company is changing its business model in India and evaluating options to continue to serve its customers.,""These actions are aligned with The Rewire which is planned to continue through the end of 2020, leading to The Hardwire, a new strategic plan for 2021-2025 aimed at building desirability for the Harley-Davidson brand and products,"" said the statement.,From its entry to exit, Harley-Davidson's journey in the country witnessed governments of India and the US using it as a bargaining chip.,In April 2007, the then Indian Government had relaxed emission and testing norms, paving the way for import of Harley Davidson bikes to India, in return for allowing mango exports from the country to the US.,The import relaxation was restricted to the shipments of motorcycles up to 800 cc engine capacity or above subject to compliance to Euro III emission norms.,Later in 2009, the company announced the establishment of its operations in India, followed by starting of sales of its bikes a year later. Then the company set up its completely knocked down assembly plant in Haryana and started rolling out assembled bikes from the unit in the early part of 2011.,The company's assembly plant at Bawal in Haryana was its second facility outside of the US after Brazil, and it had planned to use the unit to export to Europe and South-East Asian markets.,In the recent past, US President Donald Trump criticised India's high import tariff on the iconic Harley Davidson motorcycles as ""unacceptable"" as the two countries negotiated for an elusive trade deal.,In the SEC filing, the company said as a result of the actions approved from August 6, 2020, through September 23, 2020, it expected to incur restructuring expenses of around USD 75 million in 2020, of which around 80 per cent were expected to be cash expenditures, including one-time termination benefits of close to USD 3 million, non-current asset adjustments of approximately USD 5 million, and contract termination and other costs close to USD 67 million.,As per the filing, the full implementation of these 'Rewire' actions may require the company to commit more funds for additional contract termination and other costs.,Including previously disclosed restructuring charges, the company expects total restructuring expenses associated with Rewire restructuring actions approved through September 23, 2020, of approximately USD 169 million in 2020, the filing said.,The company expects to complete the restructuring activities approved through September 23, 2020, within the next 12 months, it added.,Harley Davidson's portfolio in India includes bikes like Street 750 and Iron 883, among others with prices starting from Rs 4.69 lakh and going up over Rs 18 lakh.

It can take up to 30 days to obtain preliminary approval to export such technology.,Chinese commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng told reporters on Thursday that the application had been received and would be handled in accordance with relevant regulations and procedures.,ByteDance has said its deal with Oracle and Walmart will see the creation of a standalone US company and does not involve any transfer of technology, though Oracle will be able to inspect TikTok US source code.,It has also said the deal needs approval from both China and the United States.,However, the companies have issued conflicting statements over the terms of the agreement they reached with the White House.,ByteDance said it would establish a US subsidiary called TikTok Global of which it will own 80 per cent.

"Sector regulator TRAI on Tuesday suggested that the Telecom Department should establish a multi-stakeholder body to ensure that internet providers adhere to the provisions of net neutrality, as it spelt out the broad contours of the proposed panel.,The role of the multi-stakeholder body would be to provide advice and support to Department of Telecom (DoT) in monitoring and enforcement of net neutrality principles, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) said.,Releasing its detailed recommendations on ‘Traffic management practices and multi-stakeholder body for net neutrality’, the two aspects enshrined in the net neutrality principles, TRAI said the proposed panel should comprise all telecom service providers and internet providers and other stakeholders such as content providers, researcher, academic and technical community, civil society organisations, consumers, and the government.,“The DoT may establish a multi-stakeholder body (MSB) to ensure that Internet Access Providers adhere to the provisions of net neutrality in their license,” TRAI said in its recommendations.,The proposed body would be responsible for providing support to DoT in creating and maintaining repository of traffic management practices, investigate complaints regarding violation of net neutrality, submitting reports based on monitoring of internet services, probe of incidents, and review of reports submitted by its members.,It can also help in recommending suitable technical standards and methodologies on matters pertaining to best practices to be adopted for internet traffic management.,“The functions of the MSB would be to perform the tasks of compilation and harmonisation of traffic management practices across all internet access service providers, maintain and publish repository of traffic management practices...,” TRAI said in a statement.,It would also help prepare the technical standards and define methodologies in matters pertaining to net neutrality.,TRAI suggested that the MSB could be set up by DoT as a non-profit entity. Further, it may start by registering all licensed service providers as mandatory members, and then invite other stakeholders to become its members.,The body may further modify or define its structure and procedures with the approval of the Telecom Department, the regulator said.,TRAI’s recommendations also talk of process for creation of a repository of reasonable and necessary traffic management practices that internet players can adopt for managing traffic on their networks.,“The DoT may define the process for creation and maintenance of a repository of reasonable TMPs (Traffic Management Practices),” it said.,This work shall be managed with the help of the MSB.,“The DoT may frame a policy for internet access service providers to inform affected users regarding the impact of applied traffic management practices,” TRAI said, adding that players should be required to maintain a “complete and accurate record” of instances of application of traffic management rules for future reference.,The net neutrality principles prohibit service providers from discriminating against internet content and services by blocking, throttling or according preferential higher speeds.,Simply put, this means that entire internet traffic should be available to everyone on equal terms without general discrimination.,Earlier, the government had accepted TRAI’s recommendations on net neutrality with slight modifications to the regulator’s suggestion, and had then approached it for additional views on nuances like traffic management practices (TMPs) and multi-stakeholder body.

This move was undertaken to protect the livelihoods of its 60,000 employees and over 1,00,000 migrant workers, it added.,""The action by Tata Sons to block this crucial fund raise, without any heed for the collateral consequences is the latest demonstration of their vindictive mind-set,"" the statement said.,Stating that the current situation has forced the Mistry family to sit back and reflect on the past, present and possible future for all stakeholders, the SP group said, ""The past oppressive actions and the latest vindictive move by Tata Sons that impact the livelihoods of the wider SP Group community leads to the inexplicable conclusion that the mutual co-existence of both groups at Tata Sons would be infeasible"".,The SP-Tata relationship, spanning over 70 years, was forged on mutual trust, good faith, and friendship. Today, it is with a heavy heart that the Mistry family believes that a separation of interests would best serve all stakeholder groups, it added.,When contacted, Tata Sons spokespersons declined to comment.,The SP Group claimed that as the largest minority shareholder owning an 18.37 per cent stake, the role hitherto played by it was always ""one of guardianship with an aim to protect the best interests of the Tata group"".,""The SP Group had always used its voting rights as a shareholder for the best interest of the Tata Group.

Be it the operations of Tata Steel UK, where over the last three years alone the operational losses have increased by an additional Rs 11,000 crore or the Group's aviation businesses. These actions, or lack thereof, have meant that the total debt in the major Tata group companies has increased by approximately Rs 1,00,000 crore in the last three years, it added.,""Excluding TCS, the last quarter's losses of all the listed group companies of approximately 14,000 crores causes great concern.

A year later, Vodafone challenged the tax demand under the Dutch BIT.,Sources said the company in April 2014 served the notice of arbitration after out-of-court dispute resolution talks failed.,The tax department in February 2016 served a demand notice of Rs 22,100 crore, including interest accruing since the date of the original demand.,Vodafone has always maintained that there is no liability and that it will “continue to defend vigorously any allegation that VIHBV or Vodafone India Ltd is liable to pay tax in connection with the transaction with Hutchison and will continue to exercise all rights to seek redress”.,Besides Vodafone, the Indian government also used the retrospective tax legislation to seek Rs 10,247 crore from British oil explorer Cairn Energy Plc over a 2006 reorganisation of its Indian businesses.,Commenting on the judgment, Kumarmanglam Vijay of J Sagar Associates said, “Vodafone’s win in the arbitration against the government in the retrospective taxation of indirect transfers is very significant as it may cause other similarly placed companies to seek arbitral reliefs.”           “While many bilateral investment treaties have been scrapped by government or modified not to cover taxation within their ambit, this space is likely to witness further action,” he said.,Soman Chandwari of KS Legal & Associates said the recent Supreme Court judgment providing a 10-year repayment period for debt-ridden telecom companies brought some respite for Vodafone-Idea.,“It would be interesting to observe the implications of this decision on other international arbitration cases over retrospective tax claims and cancellation of contracts against companies like Cairn Energy and a dozen others if others were to follow suit,” she added.

"Neeraj Bagga,Tribune News Service,Amritsar, September 23,Unable to meet the fixed expenditures, many tenants have left commercial premises due to the recessionary trend spiralling out of the Covid-19 lockdown.,A majority of these tenants were fence sitters as far as liquidity was concerned. They could not absorb a lockdown-like blow and had to abandon the field. So, rental price in the commercial markets within the city plunged up to 12 per cent.,Also, they say they got no support from the government or the property owners to withstand the crisis. On the other hand, fixed expenditures like staff’’s salary, power tariff, rent, tax, loan, etc., remained unchanged.,Sanjay Vasudev, a real estate expert, said a small section of such tenants with enough savings were out in the market to buy commercial properties to get benefit from the slowdown.,He elaborated that property prices had varied segments. Commercial and residential segments within the city suffered a minor 5 per cent correction, while the demand is largely standstill. On the other hand, residential and commercial components of the localities situated out of the bypasses suffered maximum decline. Prices in the residential localities came down between 20 and 25 per cent. The rates of commercial properties plummeted between 30 and 40 per cent.,Even in this scenario, the number of customers has also halved in comparison to those available before the Covid-era in the market.,Even then, there appears to be a silver lining as far as the properties of the Amritsar Improvement Trust are concerned.

He said people invariably repose faith in the localities set up by the Trust. He said plots in some localities got low-price bid but this could be referred to as correction.,He said preference of people to buy properties in the schemes of the Trust could be attributed to the massive maintenance facilities in terms of sewerage, potable water supply and other civic amenities being ensured.","Sep 24, 2020

"Vijay C Roy,Tribune News Service,Chandigarh, September 25,The absence of seed capital and venture funding support notwithstanding, a couple of startups in the technology space have relocated to Punjab in the past few years. According to entrepreneurs, low operating cost and good Wi-Fi infrastructure are major factors for attracting new investments.,Jorie Healthcare Partners, a Chicago-based company providing revenue cycle management and practice management services to the US healthcare industry, set up an Indian arm — Jorie Healthcare (P) Ltd — in Mohali with an investment of over $7 million in September 2019. Since its inception, it has grown from 11 employees to over 250 today.,Jaspinder Singh, Founder, S30,Exponential growth,Shifting to inexpensive places like Punjab has enabled us to provide services at one-fifth of the cost than our nearest competitor and it has resulted in an exponential growth. ,Dwelling upon the reasons behind setting up operations in Punjab, Jorie Healthcare Partners’ CEO Anita Sumra Singh said, “I was overwhelmed by the growth of industry in Hyderabad, Bangalore and Delhi, but there was stagnation. I wanted fresh approach and that’s when I decided to visit Chandigarh. The entire belt spanning Punjab and Himachal is evolving and there is a huge enthusiasm. I would prefer to invest in such an environment.”,The company intends to play a pivotal role in digitising data of Indian healthcare system.,Similarly, S30 — an edtech startup that prepares US for FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) companies via live zoom classes — relocated to Ludhiana in April this year.

Over the past four months of the pandemic, we have a monthly recurring revenue of $30,000,” said Jaspinder Singh, founder, S30.,Similarly, Taranjeet Singh Bhamra, an NRI, returned home in 2015 with over a decade-long experience with MNCs and incorporated Agnext — an agritech company — and chose Punjab as its head office.

"New Delhi, September 26,The Finance Ministry sources have countered the CAG audit finding of the Central Government wrongly retaining Rs 47,272 crore of GST compensation cess meant for states, saying temporary retention cannot be termed as diversion.,Days after the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) flagged that the Centre in the first two years of the GST implementation wrongly retained GST compensation cess that was meant to be used specifically to compensate states for loss of revenue, Ministry sources said compensation due for the year 2017-18 and 2018-19 was fully paid to states.,“Time taken in the reconciliation of compensation receipts can’t be termed as diversion of GST cess fund when the dues to states were fully released by the central government,” they said.,Sources said in 2017-18, Rs 62,611 crore was collected, out of which the government released full compensation dues of Rs 41,146 crore to the states and Union Territories (UTs).,In 2018-19, an amount of Rs 95,081 crore was collected, out of which Rs 69,275 crore was paid as full compensation dues to states and UTs.,They said an amount of Rs 47,271 crore collected in the 2017-18 and 2018-19 had remained unutilised for reconciliation post full payment of GST compensation dues.,For the year 2019-20, the Central Government released Rs 1,65,302 crore as GST compensation against a cess collection of Rs 95,444 crore which it could do so with the unutilised cess of Rs 47,271 crore.,The GST (Compensation to States) Act guarantees all states an annual growth rate of 14 per cent in their GST revenue in the first five years of implementation of GST beginning July 2017. It was introduced as a relief for states for the loss of revenues arising from the implementation of GST.,If a state’s revenue grows slower than 14 per cent, it is supposed to be compensated by the Centre using the funds specifically collected as compensation cess. To provide these grants, a GST compensation cess is levied on certain luxury and sin goods.,The collected compensation cess flows into the consolidated fund of India (CFI), and is then transferred to the Public Account of India, where a GST compensation cess account has been created. States are compensated bi-monthly from the accumulated funds in this account.,However, instead of transferring the entire GST cess amount to the GST compensation fund during 2017-18 and 2018-19, the CAG found that the Centre retained these funds in the CFI and used it for other purposes.,The Finance Ministry sources said the compensation receipt in the CFI was subject to reconciliation in the coming months, as usual, in the forthcoming financial year.,If for that reason the amount remained in the CFI, how could that be treated as diversion, they asked adding even the CAG in its report has not said so.,“The amount collected under compensation cess fund has been regularly and fully distributed to states as per their dues and budgetary provisions and by the end of July 2020, everything has been accounted for and released,” the source added.,The CAG in its report tabled in Parliament earlier this week said out of the Rs 62,612 crore GST Compensation Cess collected in 2017-18, Rs 56,146 crore was transferred to the non-lapsable fund.,In the following year (2018-19), Rs 54,275 crore out of Rs 95,081 crore collected was transferred to the fund.,The short transfer in 2017-18 was Rs 6,466 crore and in 2018-19 it was Rs 40,806 crore, the CAG said adding the Centre used this money for “other purposes” which “led to an overstatement of revenue receipts and understatement of fiscal deficit for the year”.,Sources explained that all amounts, including taxes and cess that are collected by the Centre, should under the Article 266 of the Constitution, get credited first to the CFI and then only it could be transferred to any other fund through a budget head in the Union Budget.,“The government makes all efforts to transfer all amounts collected by the end of every financial year into the fund by making necessary budget provisions,” they said.,In case of compensation cess, since the final accounts of amounts collected are known only after the end of the financial year, any amount collected over and above the estimate will remain in the CFI temporarily, they said adding after reconciliation, the amount is transferred to Compensation Fund and from that fund to states as per their compensation formula.,Therefore, such temporary retention of GST cess in CFI pending reconciliation could not be treated as diversion by any stretch of imagination, sources said.,“Since the cess collected by the Government has been used for full payment of due compensation, then it cannot be alleged that unutilized cess amount has been diverted for other purposes,” they insisted.

"New Delhi, September 26,Telecom regulator TRAI has decided to drop proceedings against Vodafone Idea Ltd (VIL) in priority plan matter after the telco withdrew contentious claims on faster speed and modified its offering.,The move brings down curtains on the controversial priority plan issue, which saw the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) initiating a probe into telco's claims of priority network and faster data speeds for premium customers.,Last month, the regulator had slapped a show-cause notice on VIL over its priority mobile plan, saying the tariff offer lacked transparency and was “misleading” and not in compliance with the regulatory framework.,Faced with regulatory heat, VIL recently dropped the faster data speed claims which formed a prominent part of its pay-more-for-priority-treatment offering and filed a revised plan with TRAI.,The regulator has now informed VIL that “the authority has decided not to proceed with the investigation/ further inquiry”.,TRAI letter, seen by PTI, noted that the operator has informed that the earlier RedX plan has been discontinued and that a new tariff plan of RedX, without the claim of priority 4G network feature with faster speed, has been filed.,“It has been further stated that VIL believes that the same would address the concerns of the authority and based on the same, VIL requested the authority to grant closure to the pending enquiry,” the regulator said closing the matter.,Earlier this month, VIL submitted a new RedX plan with TRAI as it removed claims of faster data speeds — a major bone of contention.,The company’s website, too, had stopped touting claims of faster speeds for RedX plan and instead spoke of benefits purely in terms of entertainment privileges (Netflix and Amazon Prime), travel privileges, mobility benefits and other privileges for the said offer.,The TRAI had been examining VIL's priority plan RedX and Bharti Airtel Platinum offering to see if network preference to specific customers led to the deterioration of services for other non-premium subscribers or violated any norms.,Bharti Airtel, however, was not issued a show-cause notice for its platinum plan. Airtel had withdrawn its platinum offering and offered to abide by TRAI’s views and hence the regulator did not proceed with further investigation on it. PTI","Sep 26, 2020
