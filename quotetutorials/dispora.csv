"Contending that the vote of Hindu Americans will be an essential part of Democrats' electoral success, prominent community members, including those who have worked with former US vice president Joe Biden, has said that a Biden administration would always work to have a constructive and positive relationship with India based on trust and conversation.,US President Donald Trump, a Republican, is seeking another term in the November 3 presidential election. Trump is being challenged by Biden, the Democratic Party's nominee.,A Biden administration would always work to have a constructive and positive relationship with India, and by extension, with Hindu Americans who identify strongly with their Indian identities, Nisha Biswal, former assistant secretary of state for south and central Asia, said during a “Dharma of Voting” event by Hindu Americans for Biden and South Asians for Biden.,“In a Biden administration, there will always be trust and conversation with India.,“Conversations will happen with a sense of regard and respect,” Biswal said during the virtual event that featured high-ranking Obama-Biden administration alumni including Arun Kumar, former assistant secretary of commerce and Nishit Acharya, former director of innovation and entrepreneurship.,The panel also included Anu Natarajan, former vice mayor of Fremont, California, the first Hindu American elected to the Fremont city council and Aminta Kilawan-Naraine, a nationally recognised Caribbean Hindu leader and activist who founded the South Queens Women's March in New York.,During the event, the speakers touched on the centrality of their Hindu identity, and how following their dharma, the quest for righteousness through selfless duty, led them to public service.,They also made impassioned pitches to fellow Hindu Americans to support the Biden-Harris ticket.,“Hindus participate in a quest for truth. The Biden administration will be committed to that quest,” said Kumar, now chairman and CEO of KPMG India.,Natarajan discussed the Hindu American and Indian American communities' impact on election results. Kilawan-Narine noted that Biden's connection to his faith resonates with many Hindu Americans.,Dr Murali Balaji, co-chair of Hindu Americans for Biden, noted that the Trump administration's actions against Hindu Americans contradicted his boasts of being a “big fan of Hindus,” as he once claimed in 2016.,“This administration has conducted raids against our Caribbean Hindu brothers and sisters, limited refugee opportunities for Hindus escaping religious persecution, capped immigration for Hindus coming from abroad, and revoked temporary protected status for nearly 10,000 Nepali Hindus displaced by the 2015 Nepal earthquake,” he alleged.,Hindu Americans are absolutely one of the most critical voting blocs in this year's election, said Neha Dewan, national director for South Asians for Biden.,“As highlighted at the event, the Biden-Harris ticket has a deep and longstanding relationship with the Hindu American community, and is actively listening to their voices and working to earn their votes,” she said.

" A 72-year-old Chinese-origin businessman in Singapore was on Monday jailed for eight-and-a-half years for stabbing his Indian-origin son-in-law to death at a coffee shop in broad daylight following disputes over his handling of the family business and extra-marital affairs.,Tan Nam Seng pleaded guilty last month to a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder by stabbing 38-year-old Spencer Tuppani three years ago during a busy lunch hour in the central business district, according to a Channel News Asia report.,Justice Dedar Singh Gill said this was a “vicious and brazen killing” but noted the accused’s major depressive disorder at the time, as well as his “fast-deteriorating” health, which the judge said weighed heavily on his mind, the report said.,Tuppani had made several business moves that Tan perceived as a ploy to cheat him of his company. They also lived in the same household, even after Tan’s daughter discovered Tuppani’s affair with another woman and the couple was quarrelling frequently, it said.,On the day of the incident, July 10, 2017, Tan saw his son-in-law eating at a coffee shop. Tan retrieved a knife from the company’s office at Cecil Court before approaching the younger man who was there with three friends, the report said.,The accused told Tuppani “you are too much” in Hokkien (a Chinese dialect), before stabbing him three times in quick succession and following the victim as he stumbled away and collapsed in front of an outlet, it said.,Tan stood over his son-in-law and stopped others from helping him, telling them to “let him die” and that “I wish to kill him”, the report said, adding that before the police arrived, Tan kicked the younger man’s face twice, before calling his daughter.,He said to her: “I can’t sleep at night. I have done it. I have killed him. Don’t cry. I am old already. I am not scared (of) going to jail”., The prosecution asked for 12 years’ jail, saying that while Tan was suffering from a major depressive disorder, there were “crucial” aggravating factors including the fact that it was “a revenge tragedy”.,Tan exacted revenge on his son-in-law in a “brutal, public and unprovoked killing” in broad daylight, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Lim Jian Yi.,Defence lawyer Wee Pan Lee asked for seven-and-a-half years’ jail. He said Tan is a divorcee who received only primary school education, beginning work as a coolie for a transport contractor in his early teens.,He worked his way up to become a ferry clerk and later started his own shipping and transport cargo company at the age of 27.,At its peak, the group of companies employed more than a thousand people, and Tan intended to groom Tuppani to run the business with his daughters after retirement.,However, when Tuppani handled the sale of the business, Tan and his eldest daughter each received only 450,000 Singapore dollars (USD 3,30,990) instead of 1 million dollars.,“He used company funds to fund his own lavish lifestyle… for expensive cars, luxury watches and the upkeep of (his) mistresses,” said Wee.,Tan later discovered his daughter’s marital woes with Tuppani, who had been “involved in a string of extramarital affairs”.,Tan began to realise that Tuppani would not honour his word to return company shares to him and his daughter, and realised his son-in-law had been surreptitiously recording arguments with his daughter to use in divorce proceedings, going against his word to Tan not to fight over custody.,“Objectively, to a right-minded person, this was a vicious and brazen killing carried out in broad daylight on an unsuspecting victim having a meal in a coffee shop…,” said Justice Gill.,However, medical evidence has established that Tan had major depressive disorder and was experiencing an episode at the time, said the judge.,He was also in a pervasive dysphoric state and was worried about the well-being of his daughters. This state of mind adversely affected his impulse control and judgment, and significantly impaired his mental responsibility for the act, the judge added.,For culpable homicide not amounting to murder, Tan could have been jailed for life. He cannot be caned as he is above 50. PTI","Sep 21, 2020

"UK-based real estate developer Osborne+Co on Tuesday announced the launch of its investment management business to target emerging value-add and development opportunities in the UK and Europe.,Osborne+Co Investment Management (OCIM) said its aim is to become a natural investment partner for globally-focused high net worth individuals (HNWIs), family offices and pension funds in India, north and south-east Asia, Europe and the UK, who are looking for risk-adjusted European real estate exposure. ,Despite the economic headwinds stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, the OCIM team believes a strong in-house delivery capability offered by sister company Osborne+Co can be uniquely leveraged to generate superior value and returns for its investors.,Rajesh Budhrani, Co-founder and Head of Asia for OCIM, believes that despite the uncertainty surrounding the current market conditions, Asian investors remain keen on foreign direct investment (FDI) into the UK. ,Therefore, India is among the key target markets for the new venture, including plans for an India office in the pipeline for 2021.,“Investors from the Indian sub-continent are very familiar with investing in UK real estate, in particular the residential buy-to-let asset class and second homes. Here, the yields are generally low. We, meanwhile, offer opportunities that can give a higher risk-adjusted return through value-added projects on both residential and commercial sectors,” said Budhrani, a Director with Osborne+Co.,He is joined by Osborne+Co Co-Founder Conor Osborne, and Rishi Khurana, formerly at Sidra Capital, to set up OCIM.,“We have the agility of a dynamic start-up alongside the backing of an established sister company, Osborne+Co.

"Several Indian students are among over 200 overseas student signatories of a letter delivered to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson at Downing Street in London on Thursday, seeking justice in the wake of being accused of cheating in a compulsory English language test six years ago.,The scandal, believed to have impacted around 34,000 international students, relates to the Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC), a compulsory requirement in some student visa cases.,Many of the students caught up in the row are Indian and have consistently maintained their innocence and have been lobbying the government for a chance to prove their innocence.,“We were innocent but our visas were refused or revoked and the government gave us no way to defend ourselves. Our futures were destroyed, and we were left to fight a years-long legal battle costing each of us tens of thousands of pounds,” reads the letter.,“We write to you because it is within your power to right this wrong, to put an end to our detention, deportation and humiliation. Allow us to prove our innocence by establishing a free and transparent scheme – independent of the Home Office – through which we can get our cases to be reviewed and clear our names,” they wrote in a direct appeal to Johnson.,The group has been supported in its long-running campaign by Migrant Voice activists and several parliamentarians including Labour Party MP Stephen Timms, Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on TOEIC. In the letter to the UK PM this week, they also sought to highlight how their plight has been magnified during the coronavirus pandemic.,“The coronavirus pandemic has made our situation even worse. Our support networks have collapsed, the charities we rely on have been closed, our friends and families are unable to help as they are struggling themselves. We are terrified of catching the virus and being hospitalised, or dying with a black mark still against our names. This is not the future we wanted or worked for,” they write.,Several reports over the years, including by the UK's National Audit Office and House of Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC), have flagged “flawed” evidence used by the Home Office against the affected students and raised serious doubts over the decision to revoke or refuse tens of thousands of visas.,“These students have been living a nightmare for six years. Stripped of their rights and their futures destroyed, many are destitute and suffering severe mental health problems. There is a mountain of evidence that proves they are victims of a mammoth injustice – and the government can ignore this no longer,” said Nazek Ramadan, Director of Migrant Voice.,The issue dates back to February 2014, when BBC's ‘Panorama' investigation uncovered evidence of organised cheating in two English language test centres run on behalf of the Educational Testing Service (ETS).,This included providing English-speakers to take speaking tests instead of the real candidates and staff reading out multiple choice answers for other tests. The UK Home Office responded vigorously, investigating colleges, test centres and students and cancelled thousands of visas in the wake of the expose.,It has maintained that the courts “consistently” found that the evidence it had at the time was sufficient to take action and that the 2014 investigation into the abuse of English language testing revealed ""systemic cheating"".,Last year, the influential PAC parliamentary body had issued a harsh rebuke of the government's reaction to the scandal.,“The Home Office's pace of response to the issue of cheating has either been ‘full throttle' or ‘too slow', with no middle ground. It has been quick to act on imperfect evidence, but slow in responding to indications that innocent people may have been caught up in its actions,” noted the report titled ‘English Language Tests: A Systemic Failure Affecting Thousands'.,""We are staggered that the Department thinks it is acceptable to have so little regard for the impact its actions might have on innocent people,” it said.

It would be wrong to discuss this further while the investigation is ongoing,” a UNICEF UK spokesperson said, adding that Alexander continues to have the support of the board.,Deshmukh is understood to be disappointed to be leaving the charity, which he feels strongly committed to despite the alleged events.,“After many years of admiring UNICEF UK, it is an amazing privilege to be joining its team and become a part of the UNICEF family,” he had said at the time of his appointment to the post earlier this year.,“UNICEF’s work supporting children worldwide and in the UK is more important than ever before. Globally, one in four children are affected by war, and UNICEF’s engagement with generous supporters in the UK is critical to providing vital support to children around the world.

"London, September 14,An Indian-origin entrepreneur-activist was on Monday dropped as a prospective London mayoral candidate to contest against Sadiq Khan next year after her past antisemitic comments came to light.,Geeta Sidhu Robb, the founder of organic food and juice products firm Nosh Detox, had been shortlisted as the Liberal Democrat candidate to take on Labour’s Khan but was instead suspended from the party after a 1997 General Election footage revealed her making anti-Jewish remarks.,“I apologise profusely for my actions in the 1997 General Election campaign. My behaviour caused offence and hurt and I am deeply sorry,” said Sidhu Robb.,“There is no room for any form of racism or antisemitism in society and as such I very much regret my conduct at that time. It is in no way an excuse, but the context was that I was on the receiving end of a consistent racist campaign and, wrongly, retaliated as I did,” she said.,As a Conservative Party General Election candidate in Blackburn 23 years ago when she was contesting against incumbent Labour MP Jack Straw, Sidhu Robb was filmed saying: “Don’t vote for a Jew, Jack Straw is a Jew.”,The London-based health food promoter, who came second behind Straw in that election, said she was “deeply ashamed” of the language she had used, which she is seen admitting in the footage was done in anger.,“As shown in the footage, I instantly regretted my appalling behaviour, which I continue to do. And I am actively reaching out to the Jewish community to listen and learn,” she said.,“Two wrongs never make a right. I made a mistake and I take responsibility for my abhorrent actions 23 years ago, they were never repeated. I urge you to judge me on who I am today, a campaigner committed to eradicating inequality and discrimination in all its forms,” she added, in a lengthy Twitter statement.,The London mayoral election was due to be held in May this year but has been postponed to May 2021 due to the coronavirus lockdown disruption.,So far, incumbent Sadiq Khan is being challenged by Conservative Party candidate Shaun Bailey in the race. The Lib Dem choice has proved difficult as the party’s previous choice, Siobhan Benita, withdrew from the race saying she could not commit to an extra year of unpaid campaigning. The party is now back to seeking a prospective candidate after Sidhu Robb’s suspension.,“Geeta Sidhu Robb has been suspended from the Liberal Democrats and will not be on the ballot paper to be the Liberal Democrat candidate for mayor of London. There is an investigation under way in accordance with due process,” a Lib Dem spokesperson said. — PTI","Sep 14, 2020

"Dubai-based Indian-origin author Avni Doshi is among the six authors shortlisted for the 2020 Booker Prize for her debut novel ‘Burnt Sugar’.,The shortlist was unveiled virtually in London on Tuesday after judges re-evaluated the 13 longlisted novels published in the UK or Ireland between October 2019 and September 2020 to whittle down the shortlist for the GBP 50,000 literary prize in November.,“This utterly compelling read examines a complex and unusual mother-daughter relationship with honest, unflinching realism---sometimes emotionally wrenching but also cathartic, written with poignancy and memorability,” the judges said of Doshi’s entry.,Doshi, born in the US and now living in Dubai, has previously spoken about the long journey to her first novel, which was released in India last year as ‘Girl in White Cotton’ and for its UK release in July.,The rest of the shortlist includes Diane Cook for ‘The New Wilderness’, Zimbabwean writer Tsitsi Dangarembga for the third novel in her trilogy – ‘This Mournable Body’, Maaza Mengiste for ‘The Shadow King’, Douglas Stuart for ‘Shuggie Bain’ and Brandon Taylor for ‘Real Life’.,Literary heavyweight and former double Booker winner Hilary Mantel, in the running for her final instalment in her series set in King Henry VIII’s 16th century England ‘The Mirror and the Light’, failed to make the shortlist cut.,“The shortlist of six came together unexpectedly, voices and characters resonating with us all even when very different. We are delighted to help disseminate these chronicles of creative humanity to a global audience,” said Margaret Busby, literary critic and chair of the 2020 judges.,“As judges, we read 162 books, many of them conveying important, sometimes uncannily similar and prescient messages,” she said.,“The best novels often prepare our societies for valuable conversations, and not just about the inequities and dilemmas of the world---whether in connection with climate change, forgotten communities, old age, racism, or revolution when necessary---but also about how magnificent the interior life of the mind, imagination and spirit is, in spite of circumstance,” she said.,The organisers said that readers of the chosen books will travel to India to unpick an unsettling mother-daughter relationship redefined by dementia with Doshi’s entry; explore the tender story of a mother’s battle to save her daughter in a dystopian city made inhospitable by the climate crisis; witness a woman confronting the realities of life and morality in Zimbabwe as she descends into poverty.,They will uncover the extraordinary tales of the African women who went to war during Italy’s 1935 invasion of Ethiopia; find humanity and humour in the harsh realities experienced by a marginalised family in 1980s Glasgow; and question what ‘real life’ is in a fresh take on the campus novel, which offers a nuanced account of racism and homophobia.,Gaby Wood, Literary Director of the Booker Prize Foundation, said: “Every year, judging the Booker Prize is an act of discovery. What’s out there, how can we widen the net, how do these books seem when compared to one another, how do they fare when re-read? These are questions judges always ask themselves, and each other.,“This year there has perhaps been more discovery than usual, both in the sense that debut novels are in the majority, and due to the fact that the judges themselves were surprised to find that was the case. Why were they surprised? They were focussing on the books,” she said.,“No one wins the Booker Prize because of who they are. A book wins because of what it does. What has transpired is a testament to the judges’ faith in – among other things – first fictions: they have found these writers to have much to say, and found them to have said it in a way that became even richer on a second reading.”,The Booker Prize for Fiction is open to writers of any nationality, writing in English and published in the UK or Ireland. The shortlist of six books will be announced on September 15, with each shortlisted authors receiving 2,500 pounds and a specially bound edition of their book at the prize ceremony scheduled for November.,The 2019 Booker Prize for Fiction was won jointly by ‘The Testaments’ by Margaret Atwood and ‘Girl, Woman, Other’ by Bernardine Evaristo. First awarded in 1969, the Booker Prize is recognised as the leading prize for literary fiction written in English.,The rules of the prize were changed at the end of 2013 to embrace the English language “in all its vigour, its vitality, its versatility and its glory”, opening it up to writers beyond the UK and Commonwealth, providing they were writing novels in English and published in the UK.

"New York, September 13,A Black study group that focussed on race drew Shyamala Gopalan, mother of Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Kamala Harris, and her husband Donald Harris together when they arrived at the University of California at Berkeley, a media report said.,A report in The New York Times said at an off-campus space at the University of California at Berkeley in the fall of 1962, Harris, then a Jamaican PhD student, addressed a small crowd, drawing parallels between his native country and the US.,He spoke about observing British colonial power in Jamaica, the way a small number of whites had cultivated a “native Black elite” in order to mask extreme social inequality.,Gopalan, who was sitting in the audience, found Harris' ideas “so compelling” that she came up to him after the speech and introduced herself.,""She was a tiny Indian scientist wearing a sari and sandals — the only other foreign student to show up for a talk on race in America."" Donald Harris recalled in The New York Times report that Gopalan was “a standout in appearance relative to everybody else in the group of both men and women"".,Gopalan, raised in India, wanted to hear more of Harris' ideas.,""This was all very interesting to me, and, I daresay, a bit charming,” Donald Harris, now 82 and an emeritus professor of economics at Stanford, recalled in written answers to questions. “At a subsequent meeting, we talked again, and at the one after that. The rest is now history.” The NYT report quotes their contemporaries as saying that “As a couple, Don Harris and Shyamala Gopalan Harris stood out, with their upper-crust accents and air of intellectual confidence.”,Anne Williams, 76, said she found Donald Harris “reserved and academic in his presentation,” difficult to get to know. Gopalan was “warm” and “charming”.,India-born economist Baron Meghnad Desai described Gopalan as a passionate debater, “fiery and radical but not Marxist in any sense”. Her husband, he recalled, “did take a serious interest in radical political economy, but he was a calm and patient arguer.”,""There was no doubt about that, they were very much together, very much in love,” he said.,The NYT report said Gopalan, the oldest child in a high-achieving Tamil Brahmin family, wanted to be a biochemist but at Lady Irwin College, she was forced to settle for a degree in home science.,Her brother Gopalan Balachandran said that his father and he used to tease Shyamala Gopalan about her studying home science. “We would say, ‘What do you study in home science? Do they teach you to set up plates for dinner?' She used to get angry and laugh. She would say, ‘You don't know what I'm studying.'”,At Berkeley, Gopalan became part of a Black intellectual study group that met off-campus. “She was part of the real brotherhood and sisterhood, there was never an issue,” said Aubrey LaBrie, who went on to teach courses on Black nationalism at San Francisco State University. “She was just accepted as part of the group.”,When Harris arrived on campus in 1961, he too fell in with the study group right away, the report said. He described the study group as an oasis, his introduction “to the realities of African-American life in its truest and rawest form, its richness and complexity, wealth and poverty, hope and despair.”,The NYT report added that it was in this group in 1962 that Harris met his future wife. “We talked then, continued to talk at a subsequent meeting, and at another, and another,” he said. The following year they were married.,Gopalan, who had expected to return to India from Berkeley, had later told a local newspaper, “I never came to stay. It's the old story: I fell in love with a guy, we got married, pretty soon kids came.”,The NYT report adds that the Harrises' marriage would fray as Harris took short-term teaching positions at two different universities in Illinois. As he won a tenure-track position at the University of Wisconsin, Gopalan settled, instead, with her children in Oakland and West Berkeley.,Gopalan, a research scientist who published influential work on the role of hormones in breast cancer, filed for divorce in 1972.,""She was quite unhappy about the separation but she had already got used to that and she didn't want to talk to Don after that,” said Balachandran, her brother. “When you love somebody, then love turns into very hard bitterness, you don't even want to talk to them.”,Kamala Harris, 55, has written about her parents splitting up in her 2018 memoir ‘The Truths We Hold'. Harris wrote, “I knew they loved each other very much, but it seemed like they had become like oil and water.”,She wrote that “had they been a little older, a little more emotionally mature, maybe the marriage could have survived. But they were so young. My father was my mother's first boyfriend”.,Kamala Harris is a Senator from California. She is the first ever black, African-American and a person of Indian descent to be nominated as a vice presidential nominee by a major political party in the United States. — PTI","Sep 13, 2020

"Thousands of innovative new coronavirus-safe face masks created by an Indian-origin surgeon and his colleague based in the UK are being offered free to the state-funded National Health Service (NHS) clinics to stop patients from accidentally spreading COVID-19 to ear, nose and throat (ENT) medics.,Dr Ajith George, who is based at the Royal Stoke University Hospital in Stoke-on-Trent, created the SNAP device along with fellow ENT surgeon Chris Coulson as a practical response to the COVID-19 crisis.,Their brainchild was then developed in a matter of months in collaboration with engineers at Aston University and specialist UK-based manufacturing firms.,“It’s incredibly exciting to see this device going from concept to reality so quickly,” said George.,“As working surgeons, our innovation work is driven by creating things we would want to use ourselves. COVID-19 has led to heightened awareness about the spread of disease in clinical environments, so we see the SNAP device having practical applications during the pandemic and beyond,” he said.,The SNAP device – comprising a two-part valve and speculum – clips onto either side of a standard surgical face mask, creating a hole for an endoscope to be inserted and for patients to keep their nose and mouth completely covered.,On withdrawal of the endoscope, a one-way valve closes the hole. Any coughs, splutters or sneezes during the procedure are caught within the mask, which is disposed of at the end.,ENT surgeons performing nasendoscopies, where a small flexible tube fitted with a camera is inserted into the nose, are at risk of contracting coronavirus because the procedure can make patients cough and sneeze. Until now, patients have had to remove their own face masks for the endoscope to be inserted, leaving surgeons reliant only on their own personal protective equipment (PPE) gear.,“As surgeons ourselves, we were concerned about the safety of doctors but also about the risk of missed diagnoses and opportunities for treatment of patients. So our aim has been to produce an easy-to-use, cheap device that would allow clinicians to return to their routine practice, while minimising the risk to themselves and other staff,” said Coulson, who works at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham.,He and George co-founded their spin-out company Endoscope-i in 2012, which specialises in making endoscopic adapters for smartphones that allow clinicians to carry out complex imaging work.,Earlier this year, the duo won a 50,000-pound grant from Innovate UK to help develop the SNAP device as part of the government agency’s support for innovations designed to alleviate the impact of COVID-19.,In tests, the device has been shown to dramatically reduce the spread of particles when a patient coughs, compared to either no mask or a mask with a hole cut in it. This reduction in particulate spread reduces the likelihood of COVID-19 being transferred to clinicians.,Currently, the NHS is only able to perform around 10 per cent of such procedures due to the risk of patients spreading coronavirus droplets around clinics, requiring deep cleaning between appointments.,Now an initial batch of 30,000 devices will be dispatched in the coming weeks, with 5,000 going out free to NHS ENT clinics across the country.

Another 100,000 pounds was discovered in a suitcase on the floor, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said.,“Some Money Service Businesses (MSBs) continue to pose a risk to the UK by facilitating the movement of illicit cash.,The NECC and its partners have developed an increased understanding of this threat, which is enabling more effective action against suspicious MSBs while supporting legitimate businesses,” said Rachael Herbert, Head of Threat Response at the NCA.,Nearby, officers found a further 100,000 pounds in a bag which was in the possession of Sailesh Mandalia, a business associate of Singara.,Believing the money to be the proceeds of crime, Metropolitan Police Organised Crime Partnership (OCP) investigators applied for a forfeiture order – a civil process in the UK intended to recover illicit cash where there has been no proven criminal offence.,In October 2019, the order was granted at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London, along with instructions that the three respondents pay costs of a combined 1,895 pounds.,However, Mandalia and the Singaras had appealed against the forfeiture.,All the accused, who collectively own two money service businesses, asserted that the cash was intended for legitimate business accounts, and that poor accounting over several years was responsible for any confusion.,But on September 10, a judge at Southwark Crown Court dismissed their appeal, ensuring the full sum can be recovered by the NCA.,Detective Chief Inspector Tony O'Sullivan, Head of the Met Police OCP, said: “While the three individuals are not accused, and have not been convicted, of any crime in relation to these events, the 300,000 pounds recovered will now go into the public purse where it can positively impact on communities.,“Money is at the heart of organised crime, and it is vital that those in possession of huge sums of cash can account for it legitimately.

You took the life of a beautiful, talented young woman, just 21 years of age,” Justice Timothy Spencer told Sorthi at the sentencing hearing at Leicester Crown Court on Wednesday.,During a murder trial earlier this month, the jury heard how he had felt jilted by Pravin after she broke off plans for their wedding ceremony.,At around 12.30 pm on March 2, Sorthi went to her home and once inside they talked for a few minutes before Sorthi stabbed her multiple times and left the property.,Leicestershire Police and East Midlands Ambulance Service personnel were called to the address where the victim was pronounced dead.,Less than two hours after the incident, Sorthi approached an officer outside Spinney Hill Police Station in Leicester and made admissions implicating himself in the stabbing of Pravin.,A post-mortem examination was carried out and concluded Pravin died as a result of multiple stab wounds.,“Bhavini was a young woman who had the rest of her life to look forward to. She was a gentle caring soul and came from a close and very private family. It is fair to say she was the apple of her parents' eyes,” said Detective Inspector Kenny Henry, the senior investigating officer from the East Midlands Special Operations Unit Major Crime team.,“Losing Bhavini so early in life and in such tragic circumstances continues to take its toll on her parents and brothers – their lives have been changed forever. To have lost their beloved daughter to someone who they trusted to take care of her is something they will never recover from,” he said, adding that the sentence would hopefully be of some comfort to her family.,“Being present during the trial was understandably difficult for the family and I must commend their bravery, courage and dignity throughout. Nothing will bring Bhavini back but I can only hope that today's outcome will, in due course, be of some comfort knowing that the man who ended their daughter's life has been brought to justice,” he added.,According to local ‘Leicester Mercury' reports, Sorthi had a civil ceremony with Pravin in India in 2017 and followed her to England on a spousal visa in August 2018.,However, the couple lived at separate addresses and the match did not seem to work out.,Pravin was to marry Sorthi in a religious Hindu wedding ceremony, but her family called it off a day before the murder.,Bhavini Pravin's life was cut short in a brutal, callous attack in her own home. The defendant took a knife to her house and yet tried to claim he was not in control of his actions,” said Lucie Boulter from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).,“We prepared compelling evidence that showed the court that this was clearly planned and premeditated,” she said.,When he gave himself up to the police, Sorthi alleged that Pravin had ruined his life.,His lawyer told the court that his client had struggled to cope with life in the UK during the court proceedings which were translated into Gujarati for his benefit.

In reality, Kankariya and his conspirators fabricated or inflated many of the accounts receivable, ultimately leading to LEI defaulting on the line of credit, prosecutors alleged.,To conceal the lack of sufficient collateral, LEI employees, with the knowledge and approval of Kankariya, created fake email addresses on behalf of LEI's customers so they could pose as them and answer the bank's and outside auditor's inquiries about the accounts receivable.,The scheme involved numerous fraudulent accounts receivable where the outstanding balances were either inflated or entirely fabricated.

"Avneet Kaur,Jalandhar, September 16,It was a proud moment for the parents of Harminder Pal Singh (33), who was recruited in the British army.,“I am on cloud nine. Three years of my son’s hard work and focused preparation has finally yielded results,” an elated Salukhan Singh, Harminder’s father, told The Tribune, adding that he was filled with pride and honour, as his son was now a part of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, commonly known as ‘The Gunners’, which is the frontline fighting force of the British Army.,In a telephonic conversation with The Tribune, Harminder Pal Singh said there were about 150 Sikhs in the British army. There are 205 Sikhs in the British air force and navy combined. Also, one of his companions is Amritdhari (baptised) Sikh, and they have been allotted separate rooms to do the paath.,Born and brought up in Jalandhar, Harminder, a resident of Ramneek Avenue here, is an electronics and communication engineer, who passed out from Lord Krishna College, Kapurthala. His father said his son always wanted to join the Army, as he was fascinated by the lives of officers, but his dream only got a push when he visited England on a visitor visa in 2017 and met his brother-in-law, who, too, is serving as an officer in the British army, and who gave wings to the dreams of Harminder by motivating him to at least give it a try.,His father said Harminder after completing his studies moved to Australia in 2008 and after working there for nearly eight years, he came back to Jalandhar in 2016.,“My son came back because he wanted to do some reputed job. In the meantime, we fixed his marriage, too! Thereafter, when he visited England, his brother-in-law, Nishan Singh, asked him to join the British army. Inspired by his words, he immediately started his preparation as well as physical training. Eventually, in February 2020, he got selected and just a few months ago he joined the Royal Artillery,” he said.,“It’s really a proud moment for everyone in the family, as getting a reputed job in a foreign country is not easy. People are losing jobs already due to Covid and employment has become a serious issue. Thus, I am very much thankful to God for showing us this day. There is no bigger happiness for a father than to see his son live his dream,” said Salukhan, who performs kirtan here, adding that Harminder’s two younger brothers Maninderpal Singh and Jagwinderpal Singh, were also living in Australia at present. While one was still studying, the other one was working.,Meanwhile, Ranjit Kaur, wife of Harminder Singh, said her son, who is just 3-year-old, was very fond of wearing military uniform. She said he also wants to be a soldier like his father when he grows up.","Sep 17, 2020

"Washington, September 18,An Indian-American federal judge has turned down an appeal by 169 Indian citizens who had challenged the proclamation of President Donald Trump that barred foreign nationals on H-1B speciality occupation visa from entering the US till the end of the year.,The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries namely India and China.,US District Judge Amit P Mehta of the US District Court for the District of Columbia in its order on Wednesday said Indian citizens, who were now trapped abroad during trips to India when borders closed, were unlikely to win their case contesting the travel ban proclamation of Trump.,“The 169 Indian nationals in their lawsuit had sought an order directing the Secretary of State and the United States consulates to process, adjudicate, and render final decisions on Plaintiffs’ DS-160 visa applications. But requiring such swift processing would be an exercise in futility when the complainant would remain ineligible to enter the country until January 1, 2021, at the earliest,” Mehta said.,Such an order would risk diverting limited resources away from visa applicants who were eligible under an exception to the proclamation and could create substantial confusion for visa recipients attempting to enter the country only to be denied at ports of entry, he said.,Mehta said on the merits, the court has already determined that the Indian nationals, who had filed the lawsuit and were stuck in India, are unlikely to succeed on their ultra vires challenge to the proclamation and were likely to succeed on their Administrative Procedure Act challenge that their suspension of processing their visas pursuant to the Proclamation was arbitrary and capricious.,The lawsuit was filed by Indian nationals who were recently residing in the United States in lawful non-immigrant status under temporary labour petitions approved by the Department of Homeland Security. For various reasons, they travelled to India and now must receive visas to return to the US.,Indian nationals on H-1B visas alleged that the United States consular offices, acting under the direction of the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State, has withheld the adjudication of their visa applications pursuant to the President’s recently issued Presidential Proclamation 10052 (dated June 22, 2020).,The proclamation suspends the entry of foreign nationals within certain categories of non-immigrant visas.,In his 11-page order, Judge Mehta at the same time noted that the visa hopefuls are likely to convince the court that the Trump administration must continue processing their visas despite the entry restrictions.,“But since they are unlikely to secure an end to those entry bars, requiring the US Department of State to nonetheless process their visa requests would be an exercise in futility,” he said.,“Such an order would risk diverting limited resources away from visa applicants who are eligible under an exception to the proclamation and could create substantial confusion for visa recipients attempting to enter the country only to be denied at ports of entry,” Mehta wrote.,Attorneys for the Indian nationals have filed a notice indicating their plans to appeal the ruling to the DC Circuit.
