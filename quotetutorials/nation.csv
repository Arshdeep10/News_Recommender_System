"Sandeep Dikshit,Isher Judge Ahluwalia’s biography, ‘Breaking Through — A Memoir’, will be read with more than a touch of poignancy as the author passed away within a month of its release.,There is an added poignancy to the passing away of a brilliant economist in the midst of the country’s worst-ever economic crises and to not having been consulted by the powers that be.,In her brilliant saris, coiffured hair and her presence at high visibility events, Isher Judge may have seemed to be the epitome of the Harvard-bred Khan Market Gang that the current regime deigns to shun.,But as her book reveals, it was the hard work of this number nine of eleven children of a Punjabi pickle maker that propelled her with distinction through Presidency College, Delhi School of Economics and, finally MIT. Her mentors along the way: Bimal Jalan, Amartya Sen, Manmohan Singh and Paul Samuelson.,She was among the young turks of economic liberalisation who along with her husband positioned themselves against the status quoits crowd of the licence-quota-permit-raj early on in her career.,Though the central governments of Congress persuasion absorbed the homilies that came from Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER), an institution she built herself, her home state Punjab saw fit to requisition her services only in 2005 when Amarinder Singh was the Chief Minister.,It is also a tribute to her mite in building up ICRIER that when she stepped down as Chairman on August 11, she was unanimously made its first Chairman-emeritus, never mind that this may not have been to the current regime’s liking.,As was the case with her husband, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, there was just no doubt where they stood in the politics of economic development. But like their common guru Manmohan Singh, they never pushed the envelope of economic reforms too hard. There was always an acknowledgement from them that the other side’s story also has merit and needs to be listened to.,Theirs was not a case of the converted preaching the gospel without the help of the bible. After speaking on outdated economic ideas being pushed in Indian universities, her book in 1985 on the mis-delivery of economic growth had marked her out as someone not afraid of speaking her mind while the more accomplished economists like Manmohan Singh refrained from showing the mirror to the then reigning economic czars.,Her high noon of being involved in the government’s policy formulating circles lasted for a quarter of a century. With the advent of the BJP government, Isher Judge focused on ICRIER, encouraging her wards to keep pushing the boundaries of economic thought. Her recent co-authored series on economic possibilities in waste management were as much a gentle rap on the government’s knuckles as suggestive of the possibilities of monetising the Swachh Bharat concept.,Though Isher Judge would have been supportive of all of PM Modi’s move to privatise the economy, one wonders if she would have approved its current ramrodding while lives have already been upended by Covid? Isher Judge also sought a similar end where the private sector occupies the commanding heights. But her means to achieving that aim were always gentler, gradual and persuasive.","Sep 26, 2020

And where a person is carrying on prostitution in a public place or when a person is found soliciting or seducing another person as defined under the Act,” the court said. PTI","Sep 26, 2020

"Patna, September 26,Former Bihar DGP Gupteshwar Pandey met Chief Minister Nitish Kumar here on Saturday, lending credence to speculations that the IPS officer’s sudden move of taking VRS was propelled by the intention to join politics.,Pandey, who stepped down as the state police chief less than a week ago, however, insisted that he had walked down to the state headquarters of the JD(U), headed by the Chief Minister, to “thank” Kumar for the trust reposed in him by the latter.,“I discussed nothing political with the Chief Minister. I have worked with him for long and, after retirement, I just wanted to thank him for his support. If and when I decide to join any political party, I will make it known to all, Pandey told a posse of journalists waiting outside the JD(U) office at Birchand Patel Marg.,Although the IPS officer, who took VRS less than half a year before he was scheduled to superannuate, has chosen to keep his cards close to the rest, the grapevine has it that he is all set to join the JD(U) and get a ticket from one of the assembly segments in his native district of Buxar.,Reports in a section of the media also say that Pandey might be considered for the Valmiki Nagar Lok Sabha seat where a by-poll has been necessitated by the death of sitting JD(U) MP Baidyanath Mahto.,The JD(U) draws its support, largely, from among non-Yadav OBCs and Pasmanda Muslims. The party hopes that with the induction of Pandey it may be able to reach out to the Brahmins, traditionally supporters of the Congress who have gravitated towards the BJP of late.,Pandey had hit the headlines recently for his vocal condemnation of the non-cooperation meted out to the Bihar police team that had visited Mumbai to probe the death by suicide of Patna-born actor Sushant Singh Rajput.,With a candour that is usually not associated with bureaucrats, Pandey had lashed out at the municipal authourities in Mumbai when they had forcibly quarantined Vinay Tiwari, a young IPS officer from Patna who heading the investigating team until the probe was handed over to the CBI upon a request to the effect from the deceased actor’s father.,Pandey’s comment, while he was still the DGP, that actress Rhea Chakraborty  accused of abetment to suicide by Rajput’s father did not have the ‘aukaat’ (standing) to make any snide remarks against Nitish Kumar was also much talked about.,The Shiv Sena, which heads the ruling coalition in Maharashtra, had accused Pandey of acting as a political pawn of the ruling dispensation in Bihar ahead of the assembly elections.,Shiv Sena spokesman Sanjay Raut on the former DGP’s VRS said he was running a political agenda with his statements on the Mumbai case and now he is going to receive his award.,Maharashtra Home minister and NCP leader Anil Deshmukh Friday said that Pandey’s quitting the job confirmed his doubts that in Rajput’s death case he was making comments not as a DGP but as a BJP leader.,Pandey has earlier brushed aside criticism from the Shiv Sena, saying “they keep saying many things, I don’t give much credence to it.”,Pandey had resigned from service in 2009 to contest the Lok Sabha elections held that year. His resignation letter was, however, intriguingly not forwarded and he was reinstated into service a few months later.,Earlier, on Tuesday, decks seemed to have been cleared for Pandey’s future move as his application for VRS received an expeditious approval from Governor Fagu Chauhan and an exception was made in his case with the waiver of a mandatory three-monthlong cooling off period for government servants. — PTI","Sep 26, 2020

"Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday wrote to Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar, recommending scaling up the use of a low-cost technology developed by scientists at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) here to deal with stubble burning.,“IARI scientists have developed a chemical that decomposes stubble and turns it into manure. There is no need for farmers to burn stubble,” Kejriwal said.,Experts at the institute have developed what they call as “decomposer capsules”. Just four capsules can be used to prepare 25 litres of a solution, using some jaggery and chickpea flour, enough to cover one hectare of land.,“Scientists say stubble burning reduces soil fertility by killing the good bacteria present in it. But if the crop residue can be turned into manure, the use of fertilizers can be reduced,” the letter read.,Kejriwal said this method can be a good solution to the problem of stubble-burning and the city government is going to use it at a large scale to ensure there are ""absolutely no farm fires"" in the national capital.,He recommended Delhi's neighbouring states should be encouraged to use it as much as possible.,“I understand that there is not much time left this year. But if we come together, we will be able to stop stubble burning to some extent. Farmers in the neighboring states should be encouraged to use this technology as much as possible,” he said.,Kejriwal acknowledged the Centre and states' efforts to reduce stubble burning, but said the focus has been on crop residue management through machinery.,“The Centre has been providing subsidy on farm equipment, still farmers are required to spend a lot of money from their own pocket,” he said.,There are a lot of farmers who do not have machines to manage crop residue. They burn it instead. This method (decomposer capsules) can reduce the use of fertilizers and increased crop production, which is a win-win situation for farmers, he said.,The chief minister also sought time from the Union minister to discuss the issue with him.,Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh attract attention during the paddy harvesting season between October 15 and November 15.,Farmers set their fields on fire to quickly clear off the crop residue left behind after harvesting and before cultivating wheat and potato. It is one of the main reasons for the alarming spike in pollution in Delhi-NCR.,Last year, Punjab produced around 20 million tonnes paddy residue. Farmers burnt 9.8 million tonnes of it.,Farmers in Haryana burnt 1.23 million tonnes out of the 7 million tonnes of paddy residue produced.,Despite a ban on stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana, farmers continue to defy it as there is a short window between harvesting of paddy and sowing of wheat.,The high cost of manual or mechanical management of straw is a major reason why farmers choose to burn it.,State governments are providing 50 to 80 per cent subsidy to farmers and cooperative societies to buy modern farm equipment for in-situ management of paddy straw, installing paddy straw-based power plants and running a massive awareness campaign against stubble-burning.,But these measures are yet to make any significant impact on ground.

The representation may be considered by the competent authority sympathetically and appropriate decision be communicated at an early date preferably within two months from the date of receipt of the representation,” it said.,After the High Court's July last year order, a letter dated December 13, 2019 was issued by the Centre to Gupta to convey his willingness or consent for inter-cadre transfer to Nagaland, Andhra Pradesh or Manipur cadre which are having the maximum shortage of IAS officer as on date so that the matter could be considered further in the department.,During the arguments before the apex court, Gupta's counsel had argued that the High Court's July last year order had not been complied with by the authority.,Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had submitted that no contempt was committed by the authority and under the High Court's July last year order, the Centre was to take decision regarding inter-cadre transfer of Gupta as per law., “In the facts of the present case, we are of the view that present was not a case of any willful disobedience of the direction of the High Court dated July 2, 2019 and the high court rightly refused to initiate contempt proceedings,” the Bench said, while disposing of the appeal.,It said that the apex court had earlier passed two orders in the matter with the hope that the matter “may be amicably settled”.,A Division Bench of the high court had in July last year said that “willingness/consent” of Gupta be also sought for inter-cadre transfer as per law and the entire process be completed within four weeks.,""If we fail in our duty to protect a man, who has had the nerve to stand up against a mafia and the State machinery, we would be doing great disservice to the system and setting a bad precedent, where no officer would gather the courage to stand up against the wrongdoers,” said the High Court had said.,Before the High Court, Gupta had sought transfer to Haryana alleging threat to his life for acting tough against the transport mafia in Bihar.,The Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) had earlier directed the Centre to consider the case of the officer for inter-state deputation to Haryana or for Central Government deputation.,Thereafter, Bihar Government had challenged the CAT order before the high court.,In 2016, Gupta was arrested in a corruption case and was sent to jail. He was later granted bail and the FIR was quashed following Patna High Court's order. PTI","Sep 25, 2020

"Tribune News Service,New Delhi, September 25,While the BJP swept the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, it has not been doing so well in Assembly elections since 2018. Beginning with Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh in 2018, the trend continued in Maharashtra, Haryana, Delhi and Jharkhand in 2019, a cause for concern. And this despite a spectacular performance in the General Elections earlier in the year spearheaded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.,‘Anti-incumbency’,Observers say CM Nitish faces anti-incumbency due to floods and damage to farm land. Agriculture reforms may also affect results,Issues of backward class, Muslims, etc., besides caste related issues may be the deciding factor,This may worry the NDA allies in Bihar (BJP, JD-U and LJP) who are yet to resolve seat-sharing and other issues. The BJP believes it has an upper hand given the state of the Opposition in Bihar but political observers believe the ground situation in Bihar, like it was in Jharkhand, is far from what it appears.,Observers say Sushant Singh Rajput and Ram Mandir are not an issue for the state where anything related to castes still has the potential to change the scenario as it happened in 2015. The bottom line is votes of backward classes, Muslims, etc., and their issues will decide the fate of parties. The contentious agriculture reforms also have the potential to form another cornerstone.,However, BJP leaders, who expect great dividends from the agri-reforms, claim the MSP and APMC are not an issue in Bihar.,This apart, while upper castes have grievances against Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, it seems migrants who returned home amid the Covid lockdown are also not too happy with him. Besides the massive anti-incumbency faced by Nitish Kumar, floods and damage to farm land are other issues that are expected to affect the results.,BJP’s focus areas include PM Narendra Modi’s self-reliance pitch (atmanirbhar Bihar) and monetary help, rations and MGNREGA jobs for migrants after they reached Bihar in the lockdown. With JD-U 's Nitish Kumar as face, BJP president JP Nadda is learnt to have asked party MPs to work not only for ensuring victory for saffron candidates but also nominees of all NDA constituents.","Sep 26, 2020

"The Bombay High Court on Friday asked the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) if it showed the ""same swiftness"" in other cases of unauthorised construction as it showed in demolishing parts of Kangana Ranaut's bungalow.,A bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and R I Chagla was hearing Ranaut's petition against the demolition carried out at her Pali Hill bungalow here by the BMC on September 9.,The Bollywood actor's lawyer, senior counsel Birendra Saraf, told the court that the BMC gave her just 24 hours to respond to its stop-work notice.,The civic body started demolition without giving her adequate time to respond, he said, adding that it also did not make any entry about alleged illegalities at Ranaut's bungalow in its detection report, as is mandatory.,The lawyer also questioned the ""timing of the demolition,"" and claimed that Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut had said in an interview to a news channel on September 8 that ""what is law? we need to teach Kangana a lesson"".,Ranaut had crossed swords with the Sena, which controls the BMC, earlier with her critical comments.,""Effectively on the same day at 3.30 pm, the BMC officials reached the bungalow for inspection,"" Saraf said.,On September 9, the order of demolition was passed and pasted at the property's entrance at 10.34 am, but ""the officials of the Corporation along with the requisite machinery were present at the site in full force at 10.19 am,"" Saraf said.,At this the bench asked senior counsel Aspi Chinoy, who appeared for the BMC, if alleged illegalities had been recorded in the detection register.,When the BMC lawyer replied in the affirmative, the bench asked, ""We want to know if the demolition has taken place in those cases (other entries in the detection register) with the same swiftness."",Justice Kathawalla then also remarked in jest whether the demolition happened ""in the way Advocate Pradeep Thorat's client (Sanjay Raut) wanted"".,On September 9 too, when Ranaut first approached Bombay HC and the court stayed the demolition, Justice Kathawalla had questioned the BMC's speedy action.,It had said if the civic body showed the same swiftness in other cases, the city would be a very different place.,The court on Friday asked Ranaut's lawyer to submit photos and other material to show if the portions demolished by the BMC existed prior to January 2020.,The bench said it wanted to find out if the demolished part -- whether legal or not -- was under construction, or if it had been constructed in the past.,This is a key point as the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act's section 354 A empowers the civic body and its officials to stop any ""ongoing"" illegal construction.,Ranaut has already stated in her amended petition that she had photos from a pooja ceremony conducted in January 2020 and photos from Elle Dcor magazine issue of April-May 2020 which show that demolished portions existed back then.,Therefore, the BMC's allegation that illegal work was going on was false, her plea said.,Advocate Saraf told the bench on Friday that when the civic body served a demolition notice, only some waterproofing work was going on and she had the requisite permissions.,He also pointed out that the photos of `ongoing work' submitted in court by the BMC on Friday did not have any digital time stamp but only a note dating them to September 5.,The court asked Chinoy to instruct the BMC officer who took the photos to submit his phone to the court, so that it can be ascertained when the photos were taken.,The court also noted that the BMC in its affidavit had said that Ranaut had changed the position of the entrance of the ground floor, but many more things on the ground floor were demolished.,""What we are thinking is, how was the ground floor demolished if there is no ongoing work there,"" it said.,""Whatever they have alleged in the affidavit regarding the ground floor, is all already done (in the past).
