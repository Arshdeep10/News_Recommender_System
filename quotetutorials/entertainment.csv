"Actor Anushka Sharma on Friday slammed former Indian cricketer Sunil Gavaskar for his ""distasteful"" remark about her while commenting on husband Virat Kohli's performance in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL).,Gavaskar found himself in the midst of a controversy for making an unsavoury comment against Kohli and Sharma after the Indian captain's forgettable outing in the IPL match, held in Dubai.,Anushka, who has faced negativity and trolling in the past as well for Kohli's performance, said she was tired of being dragged into cricket.,""It's 2020 and things still don't change for me. When will I stop getting dragged into cricket and stop being used to pass sweeping statements?"" the actor said in a long statement posted on her Instagram Stories.,Gavaskar was a part of the commentary team as Virat Kohli-led Royal Challengers Bangalore lost to Kings XI Punjab on Thursday night and the Indian captain did not do well in the match.,Referring to a video of Kohli and Sharma playing cricket during the country's coronavirus lockdown, Gavaskar, in the commentary box had said: ""Inhone lockdown me toh bas Anushka ki gendon ki practice ki hai, (he has only faced Anushka's bowling in lockdown)"".,In her statement, 32-year-old actor, who has accompanied Kohli in Dubai, asked for an explanation from Gavaskar for his comments.,""That, Mr Gavaskar, your message is distasteful is a fact but I would love for you to explain why you thought of making such a sweeping statement on a wife accusing her for her husband's game?,""I'm sure over the years you have respected the private lives of every cricketer while commenting on the game. Don't you think you should have equal amount of respect for me and us?,"" Sharma said.,The actor in her concluding note, said, ""Respected Mr Gavaskar, you are a legend whose name stands tall in this gentleman's game. Just I want to tell you what I felt when I heard you say this."" In the past as well, Sharma has reacted sharply to her name being dragged into cricket.,In October last year, she had shut down reports that claimed that selectors were asked to serve her tea during ICC World Cup 2019.,“I have stayed quiet through all the times I was blamed for the performance of my then boyfriend, now husband Virat and continue to take the blame for the most baseless things involving Indian cricket. I kept quiet then,” she had written.,“Today. I have decided to speak up because someone's silence cannot be taken as their weakness,"" she had said at the time. ","Sep 25, 2020

"Sometimes all you can do is pray. So, for nearly two months, his admirers, well-wishers and industry friends prayed for his recovery. But Covid finally claimed the versatile singer SP Balasubhrahmanyam.,SPB was not just a phenomenon but an institution. With more than 40,000 songs under his belt, 20 recorded in Kannada in a single day alone, his discography runs like a book of records.,A powerhouse in the south with a host of laurels and achievements, including the National Award for the Telugu film ‘Sankarabharanam’ to his name, the rest of India woke up to his voice in 1981 with Kamal Haasan-starrer ‘Ek Duuje Ke Liye’ for which he won the National Award for the Best Male Playback singer for the song ‘Tere mere beech main’.,Also read: ,Composer Laxmikant may have been hesitant while signing him for ‘Ek Duuje Ke Liye’, but the Hindi film industry welcomed him more than once. His inimitable singing prowess resonated in Salman Khan’s ‘Maine Pyar Kiya’ and continued to do so in many of his other films. If in Tamil film industry his creative partnership with music maestro Ilaiyaraaja firmed up his position, in Hindi films he became the voice of Salman. With duets like ‘Didi tera devar diwana’, his popularity soared.,For someone who knew AR Rahman as a toddler, he would go on to sing in his ‘Roja’ too. Bollywood, from which he took a 15-year-long hiatus, saw him return with Shah Rukh Khan’s ‘Chennai Express’.,Born on June 4, 1946, in Konetampet in Tamil Nadu, music was in his blood as father SP Sambamurthy was a musician and exponent of ‘Harikatha’. Balu as he was lovingly called was blessed with a soft melodious voice. From an amateur singer who caught the attention of late film music composer SP Kodandapani and was given an opportunity to sing in the 1966 Telugu film, ‘Sri Sri Maryada Ramanna’ he transformed into a legend.,Besides receiving six National Awards, he went on to win various honours such as Padma Bhushan. Yet he remained grounded and humility defined his persona. His knowledge of his art deepened with each new song. As he said in an interview to a national daily, “I know what I don’t know,” the realisation that one can never fully plumb all the depths of music made him strive for perfection.,Though best known for his ability to lend emotional feel to his songs, he elevated even regular numbers to another level. He captured the emotions of lyrics effortlessly and had a flair for languages. If his first song was in Telugu, the very next was in Kannada and he had the distinction of singing in Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, Hindi, Tulu, Oriya, Assamese, Badaga, Sanskrit, English, Konkani, Bengali and Marathi.,Besides, the singer-actor stepped up to be a dubbing artiste and even dubbed for Kamal Haasan in Telugu films. He played character roles in 45 films and believed that every singer is an actor. The crux, he felt, was whether you could transition from acting before the microphone to doing so in front of the camera. In a career spanning five decades, music remained his first love and his songs invariably rang true.,Belonging to an era when listeners could easily identify the singer because of his USP, his is a voice that will echo forever. And those desirous of ‘Tum se milne ki tamanna hai’ will forever feel the void he has left.","Sep 25, 2020

I like being connected to my close ones; it gives me positive energy. - Paritosh Tripathi, actor,I love interacting with people, but not completely on social media. If you focus on negative things you will have negative vibes, but if you see the talent on social media you will be happy and positive. Whenever I use social media too much, I detox by picking books.,- Jyoti Sharma, Dulari in Ram Pyaare Sirf Humare,The lockdown made me dependent on social media, but, thankfully, I realised that and also eventually got bored of it. It is depressive at times with the fake news doing the rounds. I went for a 15-day social media detox during this time. It was great, as I could give more time to reading, painting and yoga. Also my sleep pattern improved. It was like mental cleansing for me. - Shamin Mannan, Koel in Ram Pyaare Sirf Humare,Taking a detox during the lockdown didn’t occur to me. However, right now I am on a break from social media and not planning to make a comeback anytime soon. We all live in a world where we have this constant urge to keep ourselves updated. And this urge is both a blessing and a curse at the same time. Little do we realise that most times it grows to a certain level of toxicity. The idea is to cut-off when you require to or at least limit yourself. - Karan Jotwani, Neel in Qurbaan Hua,Social media was the only platform on which we were connected. I am a social being and would have died without it! So yes, it was a saviour, but anything in excess is always harmful. So, I did give it a break. The detox experience has been like meditation. There was no competition, no updates. - Liza Malik, actor-singer,– As told to Mona","Sep 25, 2020

Some have questioned whether Facebook is making a genuine claim that WhatsApp's privacy is guaranteed by end-to-end encryption, citing that probe agencies are now using WhatsApp chats as evidence.,WhatsApp released a late-night statement on Thursday to clarify its stand on the matter.,In the statement, WhatsApp spokesperson said, ""WhatsApp protects your messages with end-to-end encryption so that only you and the person you're communicating with can read what is sent, and nobody in between can access it, not even WhatsApp. It's important to remember that people sign up on WhatsApp using only a phone number, and WhatsApp doesn't have access to your message content.,""WhatsApp follows guidance provided by operating system manufacturers for on-device storage and we encourage people to take advantage of all the security features provided by operating systems such as strong passwords or biometric IDs to prevent third parties from accessing content stored on device.""  The NCB's investigation in the drugs case linked to Sushant Singh Rajput's death case has caught up with several Bollywood A listers after their WhatsApp chats over banned drugs surfaced.,Some WhatsApp chats have surfaced in the media, reportedly between Rhea and others, and the probe agency is now focused on a group chat from 2017, allegedly between Bollywood actor Deepika Padukone and her manager Karishma Prakash.,The WhatsApp chats seem to have been retrieved from Jaya Saha, who was interrogated by the NCB. Jaya was also Sushant Singh Rajput's talent manager. Jaya, who is part of the Kwan Talent Management Agency, was also on this WhatsApp group with Deepika and Karishma.,So how are WhatsApp chats, which were considered private, coming out now?,WhatsApp says on its security settings that there is end-to-end encryption for all their messages, but the media and message back-up on Google Drive or any such Cloud services aren't protected by WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption.,End-to-end encryption means that the messages are visible only to the sender and the recipient, and not even to WhatsApp.,To access encrypted WhatsApp data, security and investigating agencies can take a user's phone and create a 'clone' of it on another device. This gives them access even to deleted messages with a 'mirror image' of a phone after which all data can be transferred to the separate device.,Thereafter, it is only a matter of retrieving data, which agencies do by involving forensic experts. They retrieve all kinds of data like phone call records, messages, images, WhatsApp chats, as well as the data on the phone's Cloud service, like Google Drive or iCloud, including anything that has been deleted.,The NCB has said that Jaya was questioned about her chats with several other celebrities. The NCB is now probing whether Jaya procured narcotics and banned drugs for these celebrities.,Jaya's name emerged after a chat about drugs between her and Rhea, who is in jail in connection with the drugs case, was accessed by the Enforcement Directorate in the PMLA case mentioned earlier.,The defence can say that the phone was not used by them during the chat. Or as Rhea said that it was Sushant who asked her to send those messages from her phone.,Analysis of WhatsApp chats of Rhea with other entities reflected the angle of conspiracy, the NCB said.,Actors Deepika Padukone, Sara Ali Khan and Shraddha Kapoor are set to appear before the NCB at its Mumbai office on Saturday in connection with the drugs case.

"Sheetal,A singer can get a platform, but to have loyal fans, he has to bring something new on the table. Punjabi singer Supreet Singh Suri, who goes by the stage name Sur, has made a splash with his debut track Asar.,Until recently he sang in English. But touring with the British-Indian electronic music/bhangra band Swami as a vocalist made him look at his mother tongue Punjabi from a new perspective. Though Asar is his first solo attempt as a Punjabi singer, Sur still struggles to speak Punjabi.,For a Punjabi born in the UK, it was not easy to stay in touch with his roots. But now, he feels, Europeans and people from all around the world enjoy listening to Punjabi songs and that has brought about a change in people’s attitude.,He says, “Early in life, I realised that I wanted to be a performing artiste as the applause made me happy whenever I sang in front of a crowd. I joined various bands and learnt a great deal about music. That I know three languages, Hindi, English and Punjabi, proved to be an advantage. I love being on stage. It’s the only drug I am addicted to, performing on a stage.”,Asar, the song, talks about the positive changes that love brings in a person. Sur says, “When the makers, lyricist Siddhant Kaushal and I met, we focused on relationships in general. Each person had different stories to share but what came as the by-product was the realisation that if the partner is right for you, changes happen organically which doesn’t take you away from yourself. That’s exactly what Asar meant to me.”,The song was shot during the lockdown, hence the corona asar (effect) can be seen in the video. It focuses on just the boy (Sur) and a girl in an indoor setting. It was a conscious decision to keep the video realistic and different from normal Punjabi music videos. He adds, “We wanted to picturise a normal relationship and a face which looks like a girl-next-door. It’s a tribute to self-love be it in terms of lyrics or video.”,On the current music scene, he says, “It has changed for the better. What I like about this music industry is that everyone is doing his kind of music and has the freedom. Mickey Singh will sound like Mickey Singh and not Diljit. That’s what every new artiste should root for, making his own identity.”,For an immersive cultural experience that he has got from travels, living in two countries, he enjoys music from all around the world. His current playlist has Indian singers, Prabhdeep Singh and Nikhita Gandhi and African singer, Fatoumata Diawara. “Also, my all- time-favourites are Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan sahib and Gurdas Maan ji,” he signs off.","Sep 26, 2020
